MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines March Quarter 2024 Financial Results 
Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-
only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call 
is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2024 earnings call. 
Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. 
Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, and Glen will provide an update on the 
revenue environment. Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take 
analyst questions. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as 
many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. 
 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future 
events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are 
described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special 
items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations 
page at ir.delta.com. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, 
we've reported our March quarter results, posting pre-tax earnings of $380 million or $0.45 per share, a $0.20 
improvement over last year on revenue that was 6% higher and a new record for first quarter. 
 
Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, and we delivered a return on invested capital of nearly 14%, putting Delta's 
returns in the top half of the S&P 500. We are delivering industry-leading operational reliability and have widened 
the gap to our competition. 
 
Last summer, we made forward-leaning investments in the operation. And since then, our teams have delivered 
operational performance that is among the best in our history with mainline cancellations down 85%, setting new 
records for completion factor in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I'd like to sincerely thank Delta's 
100,000 people for your dedication, professionalism and hard work in delivering these outstanding results. 
 
In February, we've recognized the efforts of our people with $1.4 billion in profit sharing, more than the rest of the 
industry combined and continuing Delta's long-standing philosophy to reward industry-leading performance with

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

industry-leading compensation. Reflecting our People First culture, Forbes ranked Delta the Fifth Best Large 
Employer in America, and Delta was recently named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World 
for our outstanding commitment to safety, operational performance and premium customer service. 

While airline travel and transportation is what we do, it's the experiences on Delta that set us apart as a leading 
consumer brand and why Delta was recognized as number 11 on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired 
Companies. Exciting customer-facing enhancements are on the near horizon, including the opening of new Delta 
One lounges in JFK, Los Angeles and Boston, the continued introduction of modern and fuel-efficient aircraft, new 
premium cabin service offerings, upgrades to the Fly Delta app and the international expansion of fast, free Wi-Fi 
across our fleet. The rollout of Wi-Fi and Delta Sync continues to be a tremendous success. 

Since launching last year, customers have logged more than 45 million free streaming quality sessions onboard 
and millions have joined the SkyMiles program through this channel. Recognizing our investment to ensure the 
future of travel is connected, we took the number two spot in the travel category, of Fast Company's List of the 
Most Innovative Companies, the only airline to be recognized in the ranking. 

Loyalty to our brand has never been stronger. We continue to set new records with our remuneration from 
American Express, our most important commercial relationship and are well on our way to our long-term target of 
$10 billion. On February 1, we announced enhanced and refreshed benefits for our Delta SkyMiles American 
Express cards, providing more direct value and the customer response has been very positive. 

Turning to our outlook, with strong first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel 
demand, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, free cash flow of $3 
billion to $4 billion and leverage of 2.5 times, the three main guideposts that we shared with you in January. 

For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history of mid-teens operating 
margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Our forecast for pre-tax profit of approximately $2 billion is on 
par with 2019 and just shy of last year due to higher fuel prices. 

Demand continues to be strong, and we see a record spring and summer travel season with our 11 highest sales 
days in our history, all occurring this calendar year. Spending on services recently surpassed goods for the first 
time in five years and there is further runway to return to their long-term trends. 

Delta's core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority. Generational shifts 
and evolving consumer preferences are driving secular growth in premium experiences. And business travel 
demand has taken another meaningful step forward this year with growth accelerating into the mid-teens over last 
year. 

When you put this level of demand strength together with the industry's increased focus on improving financial 
returns, this may be the most constructive backdrop that I've seen in my airline career. 

Our industry-leading performance continues to demonstrate the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and 
returns-focused strategy. And with our disciplined approach to capital investment and focus on free cash flow, 
Delta is exceptionally well positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and deliver significant shareholder 
value.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

In closing, the momentum in the business continues to build. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, 
elevating the customer experience and improving efficiency across the company to support growth in our earnings 
and cash flow. 

I am excited for Delta's opportunities ahead, and we'll talk more about that and provide new long-term financial 
targets at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for November 19 and 20 in New York City. Please put that 
on your calendar. 

Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for providing the best service and 
reliability in the industry to our customers every single day. 2024 is off to a great start, and we're delivering on our 
commercial priorities to optimize our network, grow higher margin revenue streams and invest in our future. 

Revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year to a record $12.6 billion on capacity growth of 6.8%. 
This result is at the high-end of our initial guidance with upside driven by industry-leading operational performance 
and strength in close-in bookings. 

Since the start of the year, we've seen a sustained acceleration in business travel. Managed corporate travel 
sales grew 14% over the prior year with technology, consumer services and financial services leading that 
momentum. We delivered positive unit revenues in our two largest entities, Domestic and Transatlantic, reflecting 
the continued optimization of our network. 

Total unit revenue growth improved three points sequentially to down 0.7%, including nearly a one-point 
headwind from Cargo and MRO. Domestic revenue grew 5% with record March quarter unit revenues, up 3% 
over the prior year. The more than seven-point improvement from 4Q to 1Q reflects strong demand trends and 
improving industry backdrop. 

International revenues grew 12% on a unit revenue decline of 3% as unit revenue growth in the Transatlantic was 
muted by capacity investments from the continued rebuild of our Latin and Pacific franchise. 

Diverse high-margin revenue streams generated 57% of total revenue, differentiating Delta and underpinning 
industry-leading financial performance. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year, and we have runway 
ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities and further 
segmenting our products. 

Total loyalty revenue grew 12% on continued strength in the American Express co-brand portfolio with record 
quarterly remuneration of $1.7 billion. Following the refreshed co-brand benefits, we saw card applications reach 
new records as we are seeing the highest premium acquisition mix in our program's history. 

Turning to our outlook. Consumer demand is robust and premium trends remain strong. The outlook for corporate 
travel is positive. 90% of companies in our recent survey intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in 2Q, 
putting us back on track to deliver record corporate revenues in the back half of this year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

For the June quarter, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 6% to 7% with unit revenues 
flat to down 2% from last year's very strong performance. Similar to the March quarter, 2Q faces a headwind from 
the normalization of travel credits. 

Domestically, we expect unit revenues to be flattish over prior year with growth focused on restoring our core 
hubs where departures and seats are not yet fully restored. The final stage of our core hub restoration will be the 
full return of regional flying. 

Pilot hiring has stabilized, increasing the capacity we expect to fly over the summer. We expect progressive 
improvement through 2025, driving higher asset utilization and improving our profitability. 

In the Transatlantic, we are looking forward to another strong summer with record revenues. 2Q unit revenues 
are expected to be similar to the last year as we lap record performance and benefit from the healthy demand for 
our premium cabins and improved corporate trends. 

In Latin America, profitability remains solid. Unit revenues are expected to be down double-digits due to pressure 
in short-haul leisure markets. These markets are expected to see healthy improvements in the second half of the 
year as supply and demand comes back into balance. 

Our flying into Deep South America, we are very pleased with the results. We are increasing capacity about 40% 
with minimal impact to unit revenues, as we continue to deepen our ties with our JV partner, LATAM. 

We expect Pacific unit revenues to be in line with the prior year on 30% growth in capacity, driven by strong 
demand for Korea and Japan, offsetting lower unit revenues in China. Profitability is expected to set a record, as 
we continue to harvest the benefits of our multiyear restructuring. 

In closing, I'm pleased with how we have started 2024. Delta is continuing to lead on all fronts with industry-
leading margin and returns, highlighting the strength of our trusted brand and differentiated commercial strategy. 

And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of 
$380 million, an improvement of $163 million over last year, earnings of $0.45 per share was at the upper end of 
our guidance as great operational performance and strong demand more than offset higher-than-expected fuel 
prices. Operational excellence is central to Delta's brand promise, and I couldn't be prouder of how our teams are 
delivering record reliability for our customers. 

A strong completion factor drove a 1 point of higher capacity and non-fuel unit cost favorability. Non-fuel CASM 
was 1.5% above last year and ahead of guidance. Fuel prices averaged $2.76 per gallon, $0.16 higher, than the 
midpoint of our guidance range. The refinery provided a $0.05 benefit generating a profit of $49 million. This was 
down $173 million from last year on more normalized refining margins. 

Fuel efficiency was 1.9% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a 
strong operation. Operating margin of 5.1% was 0.5 point higher year-over-year. Our pre-tax margin improved 
over 1 point, benefiting from reduced interest, pension expense and higher earnings from our equity investments.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This was after paying $1.4 billion in profit sharing to our employees 
and investing $1.1 billion into the business. Debt reduction remains a top priority. Our leverage ratio improved to 
2.9 times. During the quarter we repaid $700 million of debt, including $400 million of scheduled maturities and 
$300 million of additional debt initiatives. We expect to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, and continue to 
be opportunistic in accelerating debt reduction. 

We are currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch, with all agencies now on 
positive outlook following updates from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. 

Moving to the June quarter guidance, combined with our outlook for top line growth, we expect an operating 
margin of 14% to 15%, with earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.70 to $2.90 
per gallon, including a $0.10 contribution from the refinery. At the midpoint of this range, our all-in fuel price is 
expected to be over 10% higher than last year. 

Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be approximately 2% higher than last year, consistent with our full year 
outlook of low single digits. Growth is normalizing, and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on 
restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. 

The investments we made in fleet health and reliability in the second half of 2023 are paying off, supporting 
industry-leading operational performance. As we discussed with you in January, these investments are expected 
to continue through 2024, as we complete an elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks while 
managing through industry-wide supply chain constraints. 

The intensity of hiring and training has moderated. The teams have good momentum in delivering on our 
efficiency goals for the year. This will help fund the investment in our people, in our operations and the customer 
experience that support our revenue premium. 

In closing, we continue to be confident in our full year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow 
of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work 
and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what they do every day. 

With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 

Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from 
Evercore ISI. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hey, good morning. Thank you. Just on the improved cost execution, you just touched on in the script there, 
Dan, but can you speak to maintenance expense and the outlook relative to your expectations? The tone 
sounds like you're turning a corner on maintenance. And how do you think about that line into the second half 
and perhaps into next year? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, maintenances is – Duane, thank you. Maintenance is on plan and performing as we expected as we talked 
to you at the beginning part of the year, maintenance, we expect it to be up year-over-year $350 million. We 
expect that for the full year, the first quarter was on plan, and the team is executing well. And those investments, 
as I mentioned, that we made in fleet health will continue as we go through this year, those proactive visits along 
touching the aircraft. You're seeing the impact. Cancellations from a maintenance perspective year-over-year 
were down 80% sequentially, they improved 30%. So team is doing a good job. They're on plan and as expected. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Duane, if I could add on to that, I want to congratulate the TechOps team, John Laughter, whose leadership over 
there in terms of helping to make that turn. We are seeing a renewed set of confidence back in the team. It's been 
a tough few years on the rebuild. Too early to declare victory. We know the supply chain continues to have a 
tremendous amount of constraint in it. But I'm confident that we're on a good journey. It's a good path here. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe more of a conceptual one for my follow-up on corporate and the 
continued recovery in corporate you're pointing to. I assume that's generally close in. And I wonder if you could 
comment on if you're seeing a decrease in average trip length. So maybe more trips but fewer days on the road 
per trip. Any commentary on those trends? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No. I'd just say we're seeing both. We're seeing some shorter, and we're seeing some longer where people are 
blending the leisure trip with the business trips. And generally, they're purchasing a little bit further out than they 
had. And I think that's related to not having change fees any longer. So we've seen some changes in the booking 
curve, but really encouraged by what we see in terms of corporate bookings as we look forward through this 
quarter and as we look forward into the next couple of quarters.

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Thank you very much. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning, everyone. Glen, I just – I want to get back, you talked about the normalization of travel credits 
and how that still represents a bit of a headwind. Can you quantify what that impact is on June TRASM? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think we said in our previous that we faced headwinds in up to two – a couple of points. And I think we're not 
going to go into the details of that. But that's generally what we've disclosed in the past. Yeah. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Okay. Great. And then just my second question to Ed. Ed, can you just give us an update on the status of the – I 
guess, it's an appeal process with the DOT on Aeromexico. How does that play out? Or I should say, what is the 
time line of that? And any milestones we should look forward with respect to that? Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hey, Mike, it's Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. That was a tentative order, and I think, as you know, our 
strong view is the DOT really struck out on that one. They're typically a great partner. But this was an example of 
regulatory overreach, which is why we've challenged it. It's bad for consumers, it's bad for competition. It's bad for 
the local economies that those flights have served. We are currently engaged with the administration and 
discussing, I'll say, less punitive solutions than the tentative order that was proposed. 

And I would say we've had hundreds of our, I'll say, allies with respect to the connection between Mexico and 
America weigh in, in support of this joint venture. So we think this is going to take some time before the DOT 
issues a final order a number of months, but we're cautiously optimistic that they're going to come up with a better 
solution. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Great. Thanks for that Peter. Thank you.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So, Glen, when I think about the original guide for the year three months ago, I think 
it was sort of flat RASM for the year. So we're down slightly in Q1, midpoint of guide for Q2, down slightly. So

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

what's your visibility to second half RASM inflection? I guess ultimately, at this point, do you see more upside or 
downside risk to that flat RASM? And maybe just with that, like the travel credit headwind, is that bigger or smaller 
in the second half? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, I think it's pretty – first, on the travel credit headwinds, it's consistent through the year. But what I would say, 
is that we're ahead of our internal plan to get to flattish for the year and the comps get easier as we move through 
the year. And if you look at the back half of guidance as well as what people have loaded in their schedules, it 
looks like industry capacity is reaching a peak in 2Q. So I think we see a great setup for the back half of this year 
and we're on plan or ahead of plan from where we sit right now. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Okay. And then I just want to follow-up just on RASM a little bit. So if you just – last year, your absolute RASM in 
second quarter just meaningfully outperformed seasonality. And then you underperformed in Q3, right? If you look 
this year, you're guiding again like to really outperform like pre-pandemic seasonality. I'm wondering, do you think 
that there is a seasonal shift from Q3 into Q2 relative to what we used to see? And does that help in Q2? Does it 
potentially hurt Q3? I'm just curious your thoughts on that. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I have thoughts some very – yes, it has changed, and it's related to schools coming back in the south, in 
particular, earlier and earlier into August. As a matter of fact, here, I believe, schools in Georgia, go back the first 
week of August now. And so that has materially changed, I think, over the years, making the second quarter 
stronger and making the third quarter a bit weaker. But I think we – as we think about how we plan that now, we're 
incorporating that into our capacity plans moving forward. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group

All right. Thank you, guys.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, it looks like your leverage is getting to be in a pretty good place. When do 
you think you can start flexing the balance sheet for other use of cash kind of CapEx, cash return kind of over the 
next 12 months? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, thanks, Ravi. We're not in a position yet to make any comments or any decisions around that. We still have 
more debt than we're comfortable with, and that continues to be the first call on cash to continue to take risk off 
the table. Interesting, I was looking at some numbers preparing for this call. If you look at our target for the end of 
this year and you factor in that we actually have eliminated the pension obligation, which we had at the end of

2019. We're actually pretty close to the leverage ratio we were at the end of 2019, entering the pandemic. So we 
have made a lot of progress. That said, we'll be talking a bit about that at our Investor Day in November. But the 
first call will be and will be for some time to pay down the debt. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up and a little bit of a nuance detailed question here. Kind of 
obviously, with the Paris Olympics kind of being a pretty big catalyst for Transatlantic travel in this summer kind of 
– are we thinking of that potentially bringing on some noise towards end of 2Q, early 3Q? Kind of is that
something that you would caution us in terms of modeling cadence versus seasonality?
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, generally, the Olympics are not good for airline revenues. And this year, I think, is no exception to that. So 
while we see a very favorable backdrop for Europe in its totality, there are some challenges for Paris as generally 
business travel ceases to and from the local markets as the Olympics approach. So, I wouldn't say that, that's 
going to be a windfall. It's actually going to be a bit of a headwind for us in the numbers we've shared with you.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Thanks very much operator. So, hi team. I just have two questions. In the first quarter, your landing fees seemed 
a little bit higher than I would normally expect to see for a first quarter. Is that maybe you can explain that rather 
than me suggesting what it could be? 

And then for my follow-up question, one of the issues that American Express cardholders have, of which I am one 
is acceptance rate, especially in Europe. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see an improvement in that area 
as well? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. On landing fees, when you look at it year-over-year, yes, they're up. Volume, one; two, related to the cut in 
as it relates to our generational redevelopment projects you're picking up some of that expense. And then I would 
say the third item, airports across the country in 2022 and 2023 benefited from CARES. And as those have now 
gone away, they're adjusting their rates and you're seeing that come through.

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Okay. That's very helpful. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And on American Express global acceptance rates, we worked very hard years back with American Express on 
improving the domestic acceptance rates. And right now, they're at all-time highs in terms of the number of 
merchants that you can use American Express that domestically. And they are also doing that internationally. So 
particularly places that were strong, and we worked with them on prioritizing those places that Americans like to 
go for vacations. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning, everyone. So Glen, I had a question just with regards to your capacity. How are you thinking 
about the cadence as we move into the back half of the year obviously, with the first half capacity up north of six, 
3Q schedules are still sort of above your 3% to 5% original guide. How should we think about your growth as we 
move through the back of the year because it would imply based on 3Q schedules that 4Q would be down. I kind 
of find that hard to believe. But just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think we're going to – first of all, thanks for our operating teams who have given us such exceptional completion 
factors that accounted for even higher than we had planned for. So I'd say, if those continue, which I imagine they 
will or hope they will, that we would be at the high of the 3% to 5%. And I think it's a bit early to say, but I think that 
we will be right at that 5% depending on how the completion factor comes in. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
That's helpful. Thank you. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you spoke to MRO headwinds in the 
ancillary revenue line in the quarter. What is driving that? I just sort of thought given everyone's elevated 
maintenance expense, it would have been a little bit more of a tailwind? Any thoughts there? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I'd say two things. One is, as it relates to our third-party activity, it's just – we're always – we're constrained 
by what the industry is constrained by, which is material and ability to generate that output. And as we talked 
about our TechOps team, John and the team are focused on the Delta fleet. But I would say the constraint 
continues to be material in turnaround times associated with it.

Andrew G. Didora

Understood. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple for Glen. First, on the topic of RASM premiums, pre-COVID, you 
were running, what, at 20% domestic premium to the industry, and I think you were roughly flat on international. 
You and I spoke on one of the earnings calls as to what that – what the path to achieving an international RASM 
premium might look like. Can we revisit that topic? Where is Delta currently both domestic and international, and 
where do you see that heading from here in the post-COVID world? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, thanks for the question, Jamie. I think right now, we believe we are running international RASM premiums 
that have primarily been driven by higher load factors on the fleet. But as the fleet continues to evolve and we 
continue to put more premium seats in the mix, we believe that is one of the key drivers for us to continue to 
accelerate our relative performance to our industry peers. So, I think we're on a journey there, and I think we are 
now generating premiums consistently. And hopefully, we can accelerate those over the next several years as we 
execute on our plans to differentiate Delta. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
And as a follow-up, Glen, on premium. So premium revenue was up 10% in the quarter, Main Cabin was up 4%. 
What can you tell us about the constitution of that 4%? For example, what's the trend with basic economy? What 
percent of Main Cabin passengers are SkyMiles members compared to the premium cabins, that sort of thing? I'm 
just trying to understand where the 4% is coming from. Are those new customers? Are you taking share from 
discounters? That sort of thing. Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think in the quarter, we ran a record domestic load factor in the first quarter. So, what I believe drove that was 
the incremental traffic that we took over historical levels, so pretty excited about doing that in the first quarter. As 
you know, the first quarter is the most challenging in terms of loads, and for us to come through that quarter with 
the premiums that we took, I think, really is a testament to the strength of our brand. And of course, as we get 
through the year, there'll be less and less discounted seats available as you get towards peak. But generally, 
we're most open in 1Q. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah.

Jamie N. Baker

Okay. Very helpful. Thank you everyone.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So Glen, I guess I wanted to come back to domestic 
growth this summer, because it looks like you're jumping up to 6% or 7% from about 2% in the first quarter. In the 
context around this, I think investors were a little bit concerned that, that growth could lead to lower RASMs, but 
obviously, you're guiding to flat. So can you dig a little bit deeper on your domestic network priorities and maybe a 
little bit more on regional expansion? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think there – what we've said in the past, and I would like to go back to is, we kind of coming out of COVID, we 
had to allocate the resources we had available. And those resources went to our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities 
to take leading positions in places like Boston and Los Angeles at the expense of rebuilding our core hubs, and 
we're still not done building our core hubs. And so, our ability now to go back and to put seats back into our core 
where our cost structure is most advantaged and where our profitability is highest is where we're focused for the 
rest of this year. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And seat growth is about 1 point below [indiscernible] (00:35:02) yeah. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Glen, on the Latin differentiation, I think you were talking separately about 
short-haul and long-haul. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, we are really pleased with our South America performance. As I said in the prepared remarks, our capacity 
is up in the 30% to 40% range, and we're doing that with minimal degradation of our unit revenue. So, we're really 
off to a great start with LATAM, and I think we have a really great future working with them to continue to evolve 
as the leading carrier between the United States and South America in our joint venture. So put that aside and 
then say the particularly leisure destinations, there was an oversupply in the first quarter. I think in first quarter of 
2023 the industry saw historically higher returns. 
 
And so when there are historically high returns, everybody wants to do more of it. We did considerably more of it. 
The industry did considerably more of it. And listen, it was quite profitable for us, but at the expense of unit 
revenues. And so as we move through next year, I'd say there's going to be probably a moderation of capacity as 
there always is when those things happen as well as easier comps as we get to next year. So I'm looking forward 
to actually next year's comps in Latin America.

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Okay. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Connor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line 
is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just if we play back the performance in the US domestic market in 1Q, it was pretty 
fantastic when you started off saying just expecting to inflect positive in March and you saw some improvement in 
quarter then an outcome of plus 3%. You've highlighted corporate momentum and premium. But I think there's a 
disparity in just your hub performance. Can you just talk about coastal gateways versus core hub rebuild and kind 
of how things are playing out there just in general? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think we're very pleased with our coastal gateways and really, they're moving in a pretty tight band right 
now with more capacity going to our core hubs and our core hubs generally having a higher unit revenue base 
than our coastal gateways that should have a positive inflection on total revenues. And I think that gets 
accelerated in the second and third quarters. Again, we had probably a little bit more in Boston than we had 
planned on because there were some opportunities there for us to move airplanes in. But generally, we're really 
pleased with where we sit today and how the back half of this year should play out for us. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Okay. And then it seems like there's a potential for regulatory oversight to potentially pick up your – when you 
have conversations with the FAA, what are some changes that they're talking to you about just given the 
operating environment? And maybe what are you asking them in general? It just seems like it could be a 
wildcard to potential growth, maybe medium to long term. So, just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank 
you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hey, Conor, this is Peter. So just I'd say fundamentally, with the FAA, we're working very closely with them 
around staffing models because, as you know, there's an air traffic control shortage. And we're also engaged in 
Washington trying to help solve some of those, I'll say, more structural challenges around infrastructure. You 
probably have seen that the industry has made a request of the FAA to extend the New York slot waiver another 
season. And that's what I would call responsible partnership with our regulator in light of the staffing challenges 
they've had. So, great relationship, deep partnership with them. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up to Jamie's question on the premium revenue. Just kind of curious if you could 
share how much of that 10% is coming from volume versus yield and I think you've mentioned continuing to grow 
the premium offering. So just curious what the trend might be? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Right. I would say right now, the premium is probably 50-50 split between traffic and yield. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
That's helpful. And then in terms of the volume growth in offering, how should we think about that? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think we've said that if you look at the longer-term trends that we really haven't been adding coach seats 
into the domestic arena over the past 10 years. And so all of our growth has been in the premium products and 
services. I think on Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about where we see that going, but I think we 
see a long runway for that in the coming years. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. Premium product outpaced Main Cabin all the way as you look at our fleet deliveries through 2030. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Helpful. And if I might, on another follow-up, just on the domestic capacity growth with building back the hub, is 
that then where the capacity comes a lot in this kind of regional type markets? Or should I think of it as kind of 
growth in regional then shift some of those aircraft onto kind of other bigger markets that you could use those 
aircraft? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think a little of both. We've been very short on our regionals. We still have probably at least 50 regionals, either 
not flying or underutilized probably almost 100 when you include the underutilization. So that's a lot of seats and a 
lot of departures that we need in our hubs, and we're missing a lot of the core feeds from the regional feed in the 
local vicinity. So right now, some of that's being done by mainline and those planes could gravitate out. But 
mostly, we'll be adding frequencies back and that historically have been there from feeder markets into our core 
hubs. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Helpful. Thank you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q 
Maybe just following up on that point, I thought there, Glen. As you think about the improvements in the regional 
utilization, is there also some room for improving utilization to prior pre-COVID levels on the narrowbody fleet as 
well? Or is this primarily just a regional issue? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I would hope so. If we look at our widebodies, we're now at or above where we were in 2019 in terms of annual 
utilization. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. They are. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And this is going to be a game of working with our operators to improve asset utilization across the network, 
whatever they are, planes, airports. And that's the game we're playing. That's the long game, and I think that's a 
really exciting challenge for us all. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q 
Okay. And then I guess as you think about the yield management problem sort of through the summer months, 
you didn't have a lot more premium capacity into the mix, does that change the way you guys go about sort of the 
day-to-day and in managing pricing? Are there opportunities in there that you see to continue to kind of work the 
segmented cabin differently than you may have done in the past? I'm just trying to get a sense for as this new sort 
of model is being marketed at a higher level of volume and a greater distribution of the number of seats you have 
in these aircraft, is that changing sort of the upper frontier on what you might be able to get out of yield 
management? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think what we said is that, what really pushed us to do this journey several years back was the fact that on 
the premium products and experience aside, we controlled more of our destiny than we did on the commodity 
side. And so absolutely, that's been our journey is to continue to play the game against ourselves as opposed to 
playing against the lowest common denominator.

And I think we'll have a lot again on our Investor Day to talk about what we see the next evolution. But we see a 
lot of runway, just not to tease it out, but we see a lot of runway in taking this even further and using new tools 
and using things that we'll be talking about in November that I think will be very exciting for our investor base. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q 
And then last one for me is that you mentioned something about sort of improvements in retailing. Could you 
elaborate a little bit around what you're talking about there? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think that that's the Holy Grail is why did we wind-up in a commoditized environment was because we 
couldn't distribute products and services. We weren't – the industry was not geared to this and this has been our 
long journey. 

And every day, I think we get better and better and better at it, whether or not we're working internally to improve 
our own internal displays where we're 65% direct-to-consumer right now or whether we're working with online 
booking tools, to improve their display of products and services and making progress on that front as well. So this 
has been a very, very long journey. And every day, we're working on improving it. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon

All right. Thanks very much for the time Glen.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Good morning everyone. Thank you for the time. Maybe just a follow-up on Latin America, the large capacity 
growth there in partnership with LATAM obviously magnifies the unit revenue decline. 

But you've, of course, talked about making these investments profitably. So maybe can you talk about where you 
are at today relative to your expectations in Latin America? And how you expect that profitability curve to shape 
up in the coming quarters and years? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think we still see opportunity. We've got a lot of the opportunities now in our baseline. And we'll continue 
to work with LATAM to refine that moving forward. 

But I don't think you'll see this kind of dramatic growth in the out-years as we'll be more focused on turning that 
into more of a harvest mode as opposed to an investment mode as we continue to work on bridging the two 
networks together.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

Okay. And then maybe one on cost, just to sum it up, Q1 CASM performance was really good, Ed, and you talked 
about completion factors and just operations helping that. 

So the Q2 guide seems a bit more normalized, putting you guys at 2% cost growth. So is it just fair to think about 
that run rate in the context of the year with a low single-digit guide? And what are the moving pieces, as we think 
about head count, maintenance costs and any other noise you've highlighted throughout the year? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think the 2% is in line with the low-single digit. I think when you think about the variables inside of that run, 
it starts with running a great operation; when you run a great operation, that sets the foundation. You get those 
frictional costs out. And it really allows the operators. And you're seeing it in two quarters in a row to have the 
confidence and it really lean in and continue to drive not only better improvement in the operation, but also get 
after those efficiencies. 

And as you do that, we said that we're carrying head count higher than historical for what we ran in 2019, about 
10%. And we'll grow into that. And that drives the efficiency associated with that, and no change to maintenance. 

Maintenance is as we expected. But we'll continue to manage the supply chain. It's going to be the one that is – 
has the largest constraint still associated with it as we execute for the year.

Operator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Darrell Trent 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up question to Sheila's, if I 
may. When we think about probably a bit across the industry, fleets getting older, could you give us a high-level 
sense about how valuable Delta TechOps is going to be for you guys over the next 10 years, for example, and 
that competitive advantage you have versus your legacy competitors? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes, we can. I think it is a unique advantage. That, along with our fleet, our fleet has actually gotten younger over 
the last few years. But we've also given the constraints in the industry around the OEMs have leaned in, so we've 
restored the network into our flex fleet. So flying MD-80, Boeing 717s, flying the Boeing 757s longer than we 
anticipated. And that puts demand on our TechOps team and their ability to ensure that we have those aircraft

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 10-Apr-2024

And as we go through this period and it gets more normalized, we're in a period of more normalized growth and 
more consistency around equipment. It's also going to allow us to go into a period of more natural retirements. We 
haven't retired any aircraft in 2022 and 2023. We'll start that at the back half of this year and that's really where 
our team has always shined, the ability to naturally retire, but then recoup that equipment and reuse that used 
material and run out the fleets and they did it with the MD-88 and MD-90s. They've done it for a decade, and they 
have that history. And that's really what we have in front of us. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Steven, if I could add on the back end of Dan's comments, two things. In the first quarter, our overall mainline 
reliability and completion factor was the strongest first quarter in our history. And that's quite a statement given 
where we've been through in supply chain constraints that still exist. And I attribute a lot of that to the 
maintenance team, the TechOps team, having the product ready every day and responding to the opportunities 
that we see in front of us. So that's going to continue to be positive green arrow forward as we move forward 
these next couple of years, as Dan was saying. 

Second thing is the MRO, while we've taken, I'd say, a pause given that we've had to focus our energies on our 
own fleet as compared to our customers' fleets going forward in the next couple of years that's going to start 
turning back on again. And that growth rate that we've talked about is still there, it's just waiting for us. And I'm 
very, very excited as to what you know you talk about a five- to 10-year timeline on that. That business is, I think, 
is going to be – our ability to capture that business is going to be even stronger than we were thinking pre-
pandemic given what we've been all through. So hats off to the TechOps team, a lot more work to go, but we are 
absolutely on the right path.

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, as we transition from the analysts to reporters, could you repeat the 
instructions for one question and a follow-up, please. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] 
Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On operations, just wondering if you saw any benefit from the fact 
that a lot of your hubs this past winter got rain and not blizzards. It seems like if it was 10 degrees, 15 degrees 
cooler, we've been talking about grounding the airline for a little bit at those hubs. And then separately, on the

mechanical issues that some airlines have been having recently, have you reminded your employees or put out 
any kind of communication just to ensure that they're following all protocols and just kind of reemphasize safety at 
Delta? Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Leslie, it's Ed. With respect to weather, we certainly have had a nice run of weather broadly across our 
system, candidly across our country. And that certainly has helped with respect to the overall operational 
performance. But what we like to do is neutralize for weather events, and we see the performance of the airline 
weather adjusted within our own system, and we're outperforming our prior performance, even weather adjusted. 
So the improved weather just adds a nice icing to the cake. But the fundamental of the core is running at a much, 
much better clip. And as communications, safety is job one at all times every single day. We don't send out 
special messages around safety. Every day is safety day around here.

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line 
is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the request for an addition of the slot waiver through another year. 
Have you seen any improvement at all in the ATC issues in the New York area? And does the slot waiver 
extension also include the D.C. area? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc.  A 
So Mary, thanks. It's Peter Carter. It does traditionally include the D.C. area. That's the way the FAA likes to view 
it. And we still have a shortage of ATC controllers, so it's still an incredibly challenging environment. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Have you seen any improvement at all in terms of the waivers? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc.  A 
Well, we've had the waivers in place. So of course, with those waivers, there would be improvement because 
there's a less capacity in that marketplace. But absent the waiver, I think we'd have some as an industry, some 
real challenges in New York. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Great. Thank you very much.
