MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2023 Financial 
Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, 
today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today in Atlanta we are joined by CEO, 
Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of 
Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss 
costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions and then we'll move to our 
media questions. 
 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future 
events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are 
described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special 
items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations 
page at ir.delta.com. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Well, thank you, Julie and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Before we start I want to 
acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to 
the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the 
conflict. This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services and 
other critical needs. 
 
Our inbound and outbound planes to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31st to ensure the safety 
and security of our customers and employees. We are also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for 
those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific 
events. 
 
Turning to our news for the day, this morning Delta reported September quarter results posting earnings at $2.03 
per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13% and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This 
resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion. 
The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season. And I'm grateful to our

teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are 
our most important competitive strength. 
 
Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's 
financial performance, we accrued another $420 million towards next February's profit sharing. This bringing our 
profit sharing accrual to over $1 billion year-to-date marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta 
team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked No. 12 overall on TIME'S 
Magazine list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list. 
And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. 
 
Our operational fundamentals remain strong. Underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals 
and Blue Sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of 
irregular operations days early in the quarter driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent 
improvement in our operating metrics. 
 
In October we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain number 
one in on-time arrivals year-to-date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we're making important 
forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position 
us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality 
operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure. Dan 
will speak more to this shortly. 
 
During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside 
Certares Management, Knighthead Capital and others. This new investment structure combines the number one 
premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of 
Knighthead. Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers. And I 
look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this 
uniquely positioned business. 
 
Turning to our outlook, travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial 
position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers. 
Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the 
trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 
2022 with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full year 
earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. 
 
Since raising full-year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved though earnings and cash 
flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs. Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 
20% over last year, which was the high end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued 
strength in international. With strong top-line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year-
over-year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow 
and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of 2021. 
 
As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our 
people. Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We 
are seeing the structural step-up in operating cost amid-increasing fuel prices, creating some near term pressure 
on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and re-

establish equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will 
continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow. 
 
In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the operate – the 
environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we 
move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency 
are significant opportunities. 
 
Thank you again for your support of our company. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go 
through the details of the quarter. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and 
dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 
billion up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5% including a point of pressure from Cargo and 
MRO. 
 
With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the 
industry. Reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% 
over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs, where we are 
leveraging our leading positions and generational airport builds. International passenger revenue grew 35% with 
the Transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations. 
 
We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the 
fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming main 
cabin by 5 points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continued to advance our 
premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of 
long-haul flights and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor 
to our record international margins. 
 
Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less 
recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw double-digit growth during the quarter. A recent 
corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies 
expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into 2024. 
 
SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travel 
remains well above 2019 levels. Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year with continued strength in our 
American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. 
We expect full-year remuneration of close to $7 billion and our focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 
billion. 
 
Diversified revenue streams including premium and loyalty have generated 55% of revenue year-to-date reflecting 
Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry. Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to 
grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of 
our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for 
the Delta product.

Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15% implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5%, 
versus prior year. Domestic and Transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter. Pacific 
and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to modestly decelerate given capacity growth related to 
China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remain steady and initial bookings for the 
peak holiday periods are strong. 
 
The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. 
As we move through the fourth quarter, our domestic capacity growth moderates, and in the first quarter of 2024, 
we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We have reallocated capacity to 
international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-
margin core hubs. 
 
On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The Transatlantic remained very 
strong, driven by partner hubs and Southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the 
situation in Israel, as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes. 
 
In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. 
While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, 
we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. 
 
In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance that our teams have delivered and I'm confident that our 
integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. 
 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per 
share and operating margin of 13.5%. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.3% year-over-year, and fuel prices averaged 
$2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, and we 
reinvested $1.4 billion into the business. 
 
Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year-to-date, we've repaid $3.7 
billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayments on our higher-cost debt. 
 
Our leverage ratio improved to 3 times on a trailing 12-month basis. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit 
rating to BB+, one notch away from an investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our 
capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade 
metrics, with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. 
 
Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-
over-year basis. With the exception of maintenance costs, our second half unit costs are progressing as 
expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance: first, investment in fleet 
health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. 
 
On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our 
September metrics were ahead of August, and October is ahead of September. On the 757 engine, a workhorse 
in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off-wing over the summer required

larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material 
consumption rates. 
 
On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through. Engine and 
airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely 
with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a 
long heritage of industry-leading operational performance, driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. 
Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies. 
 
Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook 
for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery 
expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned, and we 
expect production to resume in mid-November. 
 
Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on 
a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6 to $6.25 per share and double-
digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong, remain 
committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth and strong cash generation. 
 
As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the 
last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is 
normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize 
how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the 
intensity of the rebuild. 
 
Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our 
core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV 
partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy 
and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability 
and capital efficiency. 
 
In closing, Delta is well positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely 
thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. 
 
With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We 
do ask that all Q&A participants please limit to one question and one follow-up question then re-enter the queue. 
[Operator Instructions] Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question is coming from Jamie Baker 
from JPMorgan. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, Dan, expanding on some of your engine comments, we're obviously focused 
on the GTF situation. I realize you're not – at least I don't believe you're directly impacted with any groundings 
right now. I'm just trying to square this situation against your MRO and your GTF in-house expertise. I mean, is 
there a scenario where the Pratt mess ends up benefiting Delta? Or should we think more about simply reducing 
the downside relative to some of your peers? Also, how does this impact the maintenance cost guide embedded 
in your 2024 CASM expectations? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Maybe first start with the geared turbofan as it relates more directly to our fleet both. On the neo, we took our 
deliveries later, so the impact will be modest to minimal. If there are any inspections or things off-wing, it will be in 
the latter half of 2024 based on the analysis that we've gotten so far from Pratt. We're still waiting on the full 
analysis related to the A220 fleet. That should be coming later this month and we will assess that impact 
appropriately. 
 
As it relates to MRO, Pratt is certainly a close partner of ours and an important one as it relates to that third-party 
capability and we will certainly support their efforts. We're working closely with them on that. We have capacity, it 
ultimately comes down to the allocation of capacity and availability of material to do the work, but we'll be working 
with them through fall and into next year on that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. That's helpful. And then for Glen, I've asked about this before. A lot of Delta customers obviously took fairly 
lavish European vacations this year. You have SkyMiles data on these folks. What's the correlation between big 
summer spenders and big winter spenders? What's that, I don't know, sort of SkyMiles Venn diagram look like? 
Because what I'm wondering about is the potential for people scaling back on their winter trips because they 
spent lavishly on their summer holidays. Any actual data you can share on that? Thanks in advance. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure. I think what we're really excited about is the lengthening of the European travel season. And that has really 
gone from primarily ending in the summer IATA season, which would be October now through November through 
the holidays, through the New Year. And really, now we're only talking about a six- to eight-week period that are 
the doldrums for Europe. So the bookings, which most people wouldn't have expected, of course, we reduce our 
schedule in the fall and the winter IATA season.

But our year-over-year comps are actually accelerating into the winter as we look into November, December and 
January. So I think we're seeing that continuing into the fall and early parts of winter, and we're very excited about 
that. And we've also, of course, expanded into a lot more Latin leisure this winter than we did last winter, and the 
advanced demand for that seems very, very robust. So leisure is still very strong and even through shoulder and 
off-peak periods. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning. If I may on – Glen, just your comment about domestic capacity being flat to down in the first 
quarter, I was just wondering if that was a decent trend for the full year? Or if it was related to also – in the last 
year, the way first quarter is kind of turned out wasn't what you expected and you were going to make some 
capacity changes? So is that related to that as well or is it more kind of weakness that you're seeing recently? Or 
maybe strength in international on a relative basis? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
It's really a reshaping of the demand patterns that we saw last year. And no shock, January and February are not 
in the northern tier, transcon to East-West markets, barnburner market, so reallocating those to warmer and 
sunnier places. So our total capacity will be up. Domestic capacity will be down slightly. 
 
Core hubs will actually be up with more emphasis on warm and sunny places in Latin America and South Pacific. 
And so that's kind of how we're profiling and really optimization of the demand patterns we saw last year going 
into this winter. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
That makes sense. And if I might also on – just on domestic unit revenue, you've been stable at Delta since kind 
of June. I was wondering how much of a contribution you're getting from restoring your hubs and separately 
perhaps, the domestic portion of international trips, given what you've talked about is the strength kind of 
continuing in Transatlantic longer than kind of historic? The reason I ask is, it seems that stable comment is a little 
bit different than maybe what we're hearing from kind of the purely domestic airlines? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Right, right. I think what domestic strength is really coming from are the premium products domestically. And I'm 
not going to speak for the other carriers; they all have coming in the next few weeks. But it really hasn't been on 
domestic portion of international journey, which is de minimis in terms of the variance to what it was last year. Our 
enplanements to – in the Transatlantic are up low double digits, but that only represents 13% of our total travel, so 
really a de minimis impact to domestic. So it's really coming from the premium products. And they're doing quite 
well, as I mentioned. Domestic first – paid first-class load factors are reaching new heights every month. So very

excited about those demand trends. And I think that reinforces the strategy we've been working on for the last 10 
years to have a differentiated product. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is 
live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thank you. Ed, in the prepared remarks I think you touched on fuel recapture. Right now, there 
doesn't seem to be much of an adjustment on a capacity side from some of your industry participants despite, 
like, erratic fuel. So just trying to understand if there's a new calculus to how you're approaching fuel recapture 
right now in the current market? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, obviously, fuel moved an awful lot within just the last couple of months. And it's the volatility of fuel that 
really hits us hard as compared to the ability to recapture it. I think traditionally, we've seen over a two to three 
quarter rise. We have a pretty good success rate at recapturing it. And when you think about the strength of the 
demand environment and the fact that across the board everyone's, not just fuel costs are up, but labor rates are 
increasing and other inflationary pressure, supply chain and maintenance costs are up. Everyone has a similar 
incentive to continue to be able to recalibrate those pricing that – those market pressures into pricing. So my 
outlook is I'm optimistic as we're going into 2024. Glen can add his own color there. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, I think you mentioned it really well. It takes time. And when we have rapid fuel price run-ups, it usually takes a 
few quarters for that to roll into the industry realized fares. But historically it's always worked. So we're looking at 
history to predict the future. But that's what the history would tell you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Okay. Appreciate that. And then, Dan, just back to the maintenance costs and operational investments. Just trying 
to understand, I know you touched on it in Jamie's question, but just trying to understand how it plays out. Are you 
basically assuming that maintenance and operational investments will be elevated in the first half? And then how 
does that roll off? And then when do the productivity gains that you've talked about in the past kind of kick in? I'm 
just trying to understand how that of – the moving parts are changing a little bit right now? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah, yeah, certainly talked about it. We're in the middle – Conor, thank you. We're in the middle of the 2024 
planning process. When you think about maintenance, as Ed talked about, it is a foundational item as it relates to 
our operational reliability and the investments that we're making here related to fleet health and the work that

we're doing on our engines. We're going to stay after here. And that will be with us at least into the first half of 
next year, and we want to drive that operational reliability. 
 
The second part of that is as you get that operational reliability, that is really what creates the foundation to be 
able to start to optimize and unlock the cost investment and inefficiencies that we talked back about at our 
Investor Day, that $1 billion-plus. And as you see that operational reliability continue to improve, our teams will be 
able to lean more and more into getting those investment buffers out, those inefficiencies that are in every part of 
our operation. And our teams are working through that as they're building out their operating plan and financial 
plan for 2024.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question's coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hey, good morning. Just on the maintenance investment. I'll follow-up to maybe Jamie's question there. Is this at 
all a reflection of your thoughts on future aircraft delivery constraints? In other words, were you always thinking 
about using those 75s next year? And then just generally, how do you think about and measure returns on capital 
for investing in something like 757 versus going out and buying new? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. Glen can chime in here, too. I think the 757 has been a fleet as we've gone through our restoration that 
we've characterized as a flexible fleet. And it's one that – it's certainly a workhorse. The returns are very good 
related to how we deployed and fly it within our network. So we have leaned on it. When you think back to where 
we might have been 18 months, 24 months ago the number that we're flying, we have reactivated more. As we 
continue to see new deliveries slide and we get recalibrated year-to-year, so it is one that we've leaned into. And 
it's one that we will be flexible on as we work through the next three, four, five years in regards to how we deploy 
it. 
 
The wave of overhauls that we started last year and we're doing this year and we'll have same next year, but that 
gets us through a heavy wave that then allows us really very viable engines that the Delta team has always been 
very good at managing the end of life of an asset. We did it on the 90s, 88s in regards to how you manage that – 
those assets and deploy them, but also get the most out of them whether it's in whole or in parts and how they're 
redeployed back in the stream. And we're always working closely then with fleet and maintenance with Glen's 
team on how to deploy them and get the best returns for them. But those are good returning – it's a great 
workhorse for our fleet with good returns. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Nothing to add other than, yeah, we took a lot of late deliveries. I think our last 75 was produced – we had the last 
one ever built. So some of these planes are not that old and we have them in our fleet and we have – but as you 
said, as we get to the end of life of these towards the end of this decade, we'll be able to really start harvesting the 
engines, which will really improve the maintenance profile of the fleet.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 12-Oct-2023 
 
Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And, Duane, this is Ed, if I could add my perspective. Your point is right, it is related to the OEMs fundamentally. 
Their inability to produce engines on time, which they're having their own challenges within the supply chain, as 
well as parts on time. And the one thing that has been a core part of Delta's strength over at TechOps is our 
ability to go into the used repair market and acquire assets and repurpose them towards our own needs. That 
market has largely dried up, given all the large rebound in flight activity, which was running at the same time the 
OEMs have been having and struggling to produce new. 
 
So I think this is something you're going to see across the industry. This isn't just at Delta. And it's one of the 
constraints we talked about at Investor Day, that's going to keep us all pretty limited in the amount of capacity that 
we can produce. But I put my money on the Delta TechOps team, because they are the best in the business and 
we'll figure this out. And we know this is a – while it may hit the expense line, we know this is a long-term asset 
that's going to pay dividends for years to come. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Appreciate those thoughts. And maybe just for my follow-up on Pacific. And, Glen, can you just remind us where 
we are in China reopen. I think there's another round of expansion here in November. And then just broadly, in 
Pacific, what are the markets away from China that you're excited about? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think, what we're very excited about is the success of our Incheon hub with Korean. And that has really 
even exceeded our expectations. We think it's the best place to connect to get to Southeast Asia from any one of 
our hubs or as a double connect. So really trying to leverage that and we'll have some announcements on 
continuing to look to increase our capacity next year. But that's really been a linchpin. South Pacific has been a 
really great surprise for us, the demand there. We're really in tune with that same high demand for leisure 
destinations. 
 
So that's been doing very well, as well as Japan. As you know, Japan was closed for a couple of years and our 
Japanese franchise is doing quite well. So you put the Pacific together, and if you recall, for years, we're telling 
our investors to hold on. We've got this restructuring coming. We had the wrong airplanes, we were at the wrong 
airports and it took us many years to get to where we wanted to be. But we're finally there and we're producing 
great returns in the Pacific and we're excited about our opportunities moving forward. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Appreciate the detailed thoughts. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Oh, China, I didn't say – China, of course. We went from essentially double daily in Detroit – double weekly, I'm 
sorry, in Detroit and Seattle to 10x a week, with Seattle moving to daily and Detroit moving to 3x. And we'll see if 
there's another wave of this. I think the first thing we have to see is, is there demand for the capacity that's going 
into market right now, and we'll keep you abreast of that as we move forward on China reopening.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, couple of questions. Just kind of want to bring it back to some things discussed 
at Investor Day. I guess maybe, first, just on capacity growth. I know you gave us a little color about how you're 
thinking about 1Q kind of domestic versus international. But mid-single-digit growth that you talked about in 2024, 
I guess in this fuel environment, would you consider that growth rate as reasonable or aspirational at this point in 
time? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, it's probably more a question for Glen than myself. But at my level, as I've just said in my last comments, I 
hear – my sense would be any capacity that you hear from us in terms of plans or the industry, you should read 
as somewhat aspirational, because there still are tremendous constraints in the marketplace in terms of delivering 
that growth. If all goes well and we get all the parts and we get the planes on time and we have the labor ready 
and ATC is not an issue and fuel prices stay reasonable, yeah, that's what's going to happen. But if you look over 
the last two to three years, we continue to evolve it. So those are just points in time, estimates as to what we 
could do. As to what we actually will be able to do, I think we'll probably across the board be a little less than that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And I would just add a comment. About half of that is run rate of what's in there as we enter the first quarter of 
next year, so the real number is half of low-single digits, which is very low single digits. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And then, I guess, Dan, just on cost and CASM next year, obviously, with capacity 
moving around, obviously the maintenance costs continuing into next year, can you just give us a sense of your 
level of confidence in 2024 CASM-ex being able to be down kind of low-single digits, or should we think about that 
differently as well? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
As I mentioned earlier, we're still in the middle of our planning process, so all these pieces are coming together, 
right, capacity, along with all the things that we've talked about regarding the maintenance. We're spending 
certainly a lot more time on that, given all the moving pieces in the industry and elements that we talked about.

Yeah. Dan's comments earlier about this is going to be a pivot to optimization is a big deal, and maintenance is a 
part of that. Maintenance unlocks the ability...

can do.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is 
live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Ed, on CNBC this morning you called out a pickup in corporate 
bookings. Could we just dig into that a little bit more. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
What have you seen since Labor Day on volumes or revenue from corporate? Any industries or regions that are 
bigger drivers that's really across the board? And anything on maybe just corporate booking windows today 
versus maybe a couple of months ago and they're still longer than pre-COVID? Appreciate it. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, we said on the last call that we anticipated post Labor Day that we'd see volumes of corporate travel pick 
up, and indeed, we're seeing that. I think Glen mentioned a couple of sectors, the tech sector and the financial 
services sector as areas that we're seeing double-digit growth. We have – I'd say across the board, we're seeing 
increases. And it's – corporate travel as it's come back, it comes back and then plateaus, come back and 
plateaus. And I think you'll see another wave of return. 
 
I think a lot of it's being driven by the return to office and getting into the new normal work patterns, which many 
companies are still sorting out for themselves. But it's healthy to see and it's one of the distinguishing factors

between us and some of carriers that are on the other end of fare spectrum. So one of the many differentiating 
factors that is enabling us to grow revenue at the pace we are. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. And then one, maybe this is for Dan. Can you just speak to how the air 
traffic liability is trending year-to-date and into the fourth quarter versus your expectations at the start of the year? 
I know we kicked off the year with really strong first quarter performance on that ATL build. Should we be aware 
of any impact from normalization of booking windows versus last year, just given the pickup in corporate volume 
you're seeing? Thanks a lot. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, I'd say it's performing as we expected. We're starting to maybe get back to a little bit more of the traditional 
seasonality. As we were restoring, it was a little bit different. And if you look at historical patterns, you're only 
down mid-teens as you go through into the fourth quarter, and that's kind of what we saw as we wrapped up the 
third quarter here and – so no. The other element that you have in there is you certainly have – we've had very 
friendly policies as it relates to credits, and customers have gotten really used to using them. And then we think 
it's obviously long-term beneficial that people have confidence to book and travel. But also consume when they 
don't travel. And those we've seen very consistent issuance and usage rates on them. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Great. Thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Oh, yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, you called out a couple sectors that were underperforming from a 
corporate perspective. I mean, I think of any carrier probably the most indexed to the automotive sector and then 
sort of the media sector with the writers' and actors' strike. What sort of drag do you actually think that had on 
your corporates, at least in the month of September and maybe what you're seeing right now? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, clearly, I'll start with Los Angeles and the entertainment production strikes that are ongoing. That has had a 
not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles, as well as now the UAW strike, which has 
curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit. As you point out, we're very big in both of those sectors. 
And what I'm really encouraged about is despite those two kinds of being things that we should look forward to as 
positives next year that our total corporate revenues are still accelerating. So despite those two being a drag on 
them and I think hopefully those are both resolves fairly, quickly here and we can get back to our normal business 
level. But you are right, spot on, that we are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.

Great. And then just a quick one to Dan or Ed. I didn't see in the release a reiteration of the $7-plus for 2024. I 
know you're still mid-budget. But just based on the trajectory and everything you're seeing now, that number's still 
fine?

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I'm probably going to ask Jamie's initial SkyMiles data mining question in 
a different way. And based on data that you have, do you have any evidence that traditional domestic travelers 
have been flying internationally more often in 2023 [ph] than maybe people doing (00:43:04) their first or kind of 
rare international trips? Just trying to see if there's any truth or data to back up the thesis that there has been 
substitution of domestic with people flying internationally this year? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'd say that's a very broad question. And, clearly, there's been an expansion of international. But if you think 
about domestic and the volume differential between the number of seats we have every day domestically and the 
number of seats we have every day to Europe, it would be very hard to track those incremental visits back to 
people who did not fly domestically because it's such a small piece of domestic travel in terms of total volumes. 
And so while clearly, the spend has been very robust for a long-haul in general, we have not seen a diminishing of 
short-haul leisure. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of, feels like Transpacific has not quite been the 
explosion of pent-up demand that we saw in domestic and Transatlantic when they officially opened. But it looks 
like 2024 might be a better year for that. Is there any way you think that the historical profitability in that region, 
which has not been great to say the least, can be better when that initial kind of flow-through of demand comes 
through with the pricing the way it might potentially be? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'd disagree with you on your premise there that Pacific has been a laagered. Pacific has been quite robust 
and I think we indicated these are our record profits in terms of margins and total profitability in the Pacific. And if 
you look at the Pacific, absent of China, it's been fully restored. So I think we're very pleased with the demand to

the Pacific, and we're – right now, that's where our capacity is sitting up most in the fourth quarter and where it will 
be in the first and through next year. And so – and we're very enthusiastic about the results we're getting there.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Glen, I know you've called out your corporate travel here 
being up in coastal hub strength, but can you talk to maybe any areas of weakness domestically? And is there like 
diverging trends with your main cabin revenue? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think, yeah, we've called out diverging trends with main cabin. Those have been pretty consistent though, 
throughout the recovery is it's been led by premium products and services. So that's not inconsistent between 
quarters. I think it's actually relatively flat in terms of the – how much premium is driving there. And 
geographically, I think what we're really excited about is the coastal hub investments we've made and particularly 
New York, that's something we're looking for in 2024. We've – we see a lot of momentum in the Northeast and 
New York in particular as things to look forward to in 2024. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Okay. And then on the outlook for next year, growing with your JVs on the international side, how does the 
changes in Mexico impact us as they move to a Category 1 with the FAA? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Right. Mexico's been a great source of strength for us through the last year and we see continued strength in 
those Mexican business. And I think when you think about what we read in the press and what you all see and the 
on-shoring and moving factories from Asia down into Mexico, we've seen really an incredible strength in demand 
from the business sector in Mexico and that's looking really robust into 2024. 
 
And working with Aeroméxico now, we really couldn't do much with them. These are things we wanted to do in the 
past. You can see us coordinating with them. We have an ATI joint venture, so we've been working very closely 
with them to continue to work on where we see strength and being able to serve those markets better, including 
the auto sector in Detroit and including Atlanta as a primary gateway to Mexico primary and secondary airports.

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Oh, thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the question. Just on – with respect 
to as you think about travel next summer on the North Atlantic, especially where US citizens are going to need 
visas, how are you thinking about communicating that to people as they book trips? Is that going to be in the 
reservation process or follow-ups? Or how do you avoid surprises? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. Q 
Helane, hi. It's Peter Carter.

Hi, Peter. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. Q 
Say – we will make sure our customers are aware of the visa requirement at various points along the purchasing 
path and the journey. And I will tell you that the nice thing about the new visa requirement is, it is a e-Visa, so it's 
a fairly straightforward process that we think it will take about 24 hours. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Yeah, I think it's like Australia, right, where it's pretty quick unless it's not. I think – okay. That's helpful. Thank you. 
And then the other question I had was just on the changes to Israel. How big actually is that in your total – in the 
total market? It's a lot of ASMs, but it can't be that big in terms of I guess exposure. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
It's a little over a point of ASMs, and we're not going to give an exact number, but it's included – the revenue hit is 
included in our fourth quarter guide. So we've extended at least through October and then we'll see what 
happens. The reason we're not saying how much exposure there is, is we don't know how this will evolve yet, so 
we're staying very fluid. But I think we feel very confident that we can get inside of our guidance ranges here with 
Israel kind of in a worst-case scenario.

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ed, I wanted to ask you a question. You made a comment about leaning into the 
cost curve and really leading the industry here with pilot pay and the like. So the question comes, how do we think 
about your double-digit margin today versus low-cost carriers and what they'll report in Q3? And margin moving 
pieces maybe into 2024, if you want to provide that or maybe the Delta versus Delta and other carriers? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sheila, you should look at our 2024 guide that we gave you with our three-year plan. The good news at Delta is 
that we have all of our labor costs at the new market across the board today in posting those double-digit margins 
so to the extent that other carriers need to be increasing their labor and cost in future negotiations. They're just 
going to be chasing the Delta cost. And I think that conversions of industry rates is something we've talked about 
as another opportunity as we look at trying to make sure we're all running a better business here and we're not – 
we have the same incentives to make sure that our costs are finding their way into our pricing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Sure. No, it makes sense. And if I could ask one more, a lot on Delta TechOps. Obviously, a big asset for Delta 
right now. Anything you could talk about? I think you previously said GTF shop visits, they're running at 70 to 80 
engines. I don't know if that was only GTF or all engines ramping to potentially 400. Maybe if you could just give 
us the – talk about the opportunity longer term with Delta TechOps and what utilization is? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. We talked about it at baseline this year. TechOps for geared turbofan engine overhauls would be in the 150, 
160 range. We have built capacity to take that to – up to 350 and continue to discuss long-term – medium and 
longer-term capacity needs with Pratt related to that. So we talk about it at Investor Day, very optimistic about our 
position, not only the heritage that we have and the great expertise that we have in the Delta TechOps team, but 
our positioning as it relates to being on all the key next-generation platforms, whether that's geared turbofan or 
whether that's Rolls and also, the LEAP engine create a real set of opportunities for us as we think about this 
business and multiples of what it can be today over the medium and long term. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Thank you so much. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could, as we transition from the analyst questions to those from the members of 
the media, maybe repeat the instructions for everyone, please.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 12-Oct-2023 
 
 

Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] 
Please hold while we pull for questions. Your first question is coming from Dawn Gilbertson from Wall Street 
Journal. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Dawn Gilbertson 
Travel Columnist, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Hi. Good morning. Ed, I wonder if you could give us any more color, Ed or Glen, on the reaction to the SkyMiles 
changes and when you expect to announce the things you might be rolling back or changing? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Dawn. I've mentioned publicly over the last couple of weeks that we're certainly receiving good feedback from 
our customers with respect to the changes. I have indicated that we had too many changes rolled out at the same 
time and we needed to go back and reassess the planned rollout for the new qualification levels. Yeah, I 
mentioned this, this morning on the CNBC interview. There's two things, though, that are common throughout all 
of the feedback, one is there is a intense loyalty to Delta, which is really heartwarming to see. The loyalty to this 
brand is great. We've worked hard to build it, we maintained it, we will continue to maintain that. There should be 
no question about that. 
 
And, secondly, that – most everyone also agrees that something has to be done because everyone sees that the 
premium number of customers that we continue to build are in excess of the premium assets that we have to 
offer. 
 
And so figuring out how to better rationalize and make certain that the service levels for our premium customers 
are where they need to be is – there's various ways to get it. We've received a lot of ideas as to different ways to 
think about it and you'll be hearing from us in the coming days. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Dawn Gilbertson 
Travel Columnist, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Okay. If I can just have one quick follow-up on that front. What is driving – in terms of reaction, I mean, are you 
seeing just feedback or are you seeing an impact on credit card signups and/or cancellations? I mean, what's 
driving this pretty quick change to your initial plans? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, it's the feedback. It's not – no, we're not seeing any change in trajectory rather on acquisitions or changes in 
spend levels. Everything continues to stay intact, as Glen, I think, mentioned during some of his comments. This 
is good feedback that we're seeing, and candidly, with some of it, I agree with him. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Dawn Gilbertson 
Travel Columnist, The Wall Street Journal Q

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 12-Oct-2023 
 
Alison Sider 
Reporter-Air Travel Business, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Hey. Thanks so much. [indiscernible] (00:55:22) there's been some analyses recently about sort of the potential 
impact of cost savings, if people really started taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic in big numbers. Is that 
something you look at, at all? Have you factored that into your fuel projections or anything like that? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, we don't, Aly. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter-Air Travel Business, The Wall Street Journal Q 
And then [indiscernible] (00:55:45) follow-up, I was also curious on potential Israel evacuation flights. I know 
there's ongoing discussions with the government on this. But would Delta be open to flying to Israel under a 
charter, if the government asks or if there was a [indiscernible] (00:56:00)? Or would you rather just fly to points 
outside of Israel? Is there any openness, I guess, to flying kind of under those circumstances? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
There are discussions, as I've indicated. Right now, we're looking at providing some additional lift to Europe to get 
people out of Europe. But no, we don't have any plans to be flying into Israel. It's considered unsafe for a US 
carrier to operate in that airspace currently. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter-Air Travel Business, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line 
is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Correspondent, Bloomberg News Q 
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask real quickly. With the ongoing slot waiver situation in New York where the 
airlines were asked to reduce capacity because of the congestion and the air traffic controller shortage, can you 
talk about how much of that Delta's taking advantage of and whether you expect that, if it continues long term, to 
start to have some significant impact; also, whether you're redeploying that capacity into other markets. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, thanks for that question. Yes, we're planning on using the entirety of the slot waiver, which is, I believe, 10% 
of our flights into and out of Kennedy and LaGuardia in order to help with the airspace congestion issues that are 
surrounding those airports right now. So what we're trying to do is have minimal impact. We will not withdraw from 
an individual markets. We will thin out some frequencies. We'll put some larger gauge in.

And any of the assets that are freed up from New York will get redeployed into other parts of our network for now. 
But it shouldn't really be very different than the summer. As you know, that's rolled forward from the summer, 
which we had 10% out and that's just extending it through the winter. So you won't see, really, I think, any 
dramatic changes to our schedule versus where we're sitting today. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Correspondent, Bloomberg News Q 
Does that become a broader problem for you if that continues to be extended? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think the broader problem is not being able to operate in the New York airspace. And so, I think we're working 
very closely with the government to see what we can do to improve the situation there. It was very difficult on our 
customers this summer and certainly, we're all hoping for some relief by next summer. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And, Mary, we really – this is Peter Carter, we really appreciate the FAA providing that relief and acknowledging 
that there is a constraint in the Northeast with respect to the staffing of air traffic controllers. And, frankly, that's 
the thing that we need to really solve as an industry. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Correspondent, Bloomberg News Q 
Okay. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Airline Reporter, CNBC Q 
Hi. Good morning. We keep seeing airfares fall, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what kind of 
discounting you're having to do in the fall. And then have you made any capacity changes on days when people 
might have traveled in the off peak and maybe they're going back to more traditional bookings, if that's the case? 
Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure. I think the most recent data that came out this morning had been flat to up slightly month-over-month. So I 
don't think that at an industry level that's a good indication. What we've seen is that actually June was our lowest 
point in terms of year-over-year average fares, and it's moved up for us since then. And that's really driven by the 
premium side and the success we've had in terms of selling more premium and the fares we're getting for our 
premium products and services. So, yes, at the bottom end there's discounting. There's also some fare initiatives, 
so it's always a very fluid situation. And right now, I think we're very – we're calling it stable between third quarter 
and fourth quarter.

And the fares that you're discounting to, is that like on par with 2019? Or, is that – like is there kind of a reference 
point for...? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah, certain markets are above, so I think the market basket is there at the very bottom end and maybe slightly 
below where they were in 2019, but not really. There's always a fare in any market that is below, but in general 
they're not. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Airline Reporter, CNBC Q 
Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Leslie. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Slotnick 
Senior Airline Reporter, The Points Guy Q 
Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Going back to the loyalty program, were you surprised by 
the customer reaction and I suppose the degree of it? And what were you sort of expecting instead of that effect? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We were certainly expecting some feedback. And by the way, some of the feedback we've received is very 
positive and encourages us not to make any changes. So, there wasn't any one cohort that was silent on the 
matter. 
 
We had a full 360 view of the perspective, but it gave us a chance to sit back, reflect on it, and there were points 
about the program that I thought we could make some modifications to. There still will be changes to the program, 
I've been very clear about that, but we're going to make modifications to what we announced. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Slotnick 
Senior Airline Reporter, The Points Guy Q 
Thank you. And just a follow-up. Was American Express expecting any changes to the premium card demand just 
lounge access? Do they think of that potentially going to fall? And if so, will that impact your loyalty revenue? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
American Express, we of course did this with full back-and-forth knowledge, so we did this together with American 
Express. And if anything, since that we've announced it, we've seen a shift to higher premium card acquisitions. 
So I think we're well within from that perspective where we thought we'd be.
