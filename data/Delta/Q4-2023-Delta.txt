Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Matthew, and good morning. Thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full-year 2023 
earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, 
Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update 
on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll 
take analysts questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can 
get to as many of you as possible. After the analysts Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. 
 
As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations 
about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual 
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such 
differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results 
exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the 
Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. 
 
Earlier today, we reported our full-year and December quarter results posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.1 
billion, or $1.28 per share, and record quarterly revenue that was 11% higher than 2022 and an operating margin 
of 10%. 
 
I want to sincerely thank the 100,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and 
serving our customers. Delta carried more travelers this holiday season than any other time in our history and we 
delivered industry-leading operational performance with the number one System Completion Factor amongst our 
peer set throughout the December quarter. 
 
To put that in context, we carried 9 million customers, a record 9 million customers, I'd add, on 60,000 mainline 
flights over the holiday period, with fewer than 40 cancellations in aggregate.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Our December quarter results marked a strong close to year two of our three-year plan. For the full-year, we 
reported earnings of $6.25 per-share. The second-highest EPS result in our history on revenue that was 20% 
higher than the prior year. We delivered an 11.6% operating margin and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, a near-
doubling over 2022. We generated free cash flow of $2 billion while investing $5.3 billion back into the business, 
and we improved our leverage by two full turns and reinstated our quarterly dividend. Return on invested capital 
was 13.4%, a 5-point improvement from 2022. A tremendous amount of progress, especially if you consider 
where we sat a short three-years ago, and I'm so proud of our team across the board. 
 
Sharing our financial success is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture, and I'm thrilled to announce that we'll be 
rewarding our employees with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit-sharing on Valentine's Day. For our employees, the 
estimated payout will be approximately 10% of eligible 2023 compensation, about double of what last year's 
payment was. I expect our profit-sharing payments will be more than our three largest competitors combined. 
 
Our people consistently deliver operational excellence with the relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage 
of the travel journey, to deliver safe, reliable and caring service for our customers. They are the reason our brand 
and our customer loyalty lead the industry, why Delta was recognized as the World's 12th Most Admired by 
Fortune, and why Glassdoor named us yesterday as the 13th Best Employer in the country. 
 
In 2023, we made meaningful investment in our people, our operation, and our customers. We provided well-
deserved pay increases for the Delta team, continuing our philosophy of industry-leading pay for industry-leading 
performance. In the operation, the investments that we made supported the best-in-class operational performance 
that Delta has long been known for. Our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week which named 
us, yet again, the most on-time airline in North America. 
 
Our people and our operational reliability are the foundation of Delta's trusted consumer brand and we are 
building on that foundation as we elevate the premium flying experience and grow our SkyMiles members 
engagement with Delta. 
 
Today, we also announced an order for 20 Airbus 350-1000 aircraft with options for 20 more, for delivery starting 
in 2026. These planes complement our fleet strategy and will offer a world-class customer experience for 
international travelers with more premium seats, higher gauge and great customer amenities. These aircraft are 
over 20% more fuel efficient than the 767s that they'll be replacing, further supporting our long-term sustainability 
goals. And with the successful launch of fast, free Wi-Fi and Delta Sync we are enhancing the in-flight 
entertainment experience for SkyMiles members. We expect to have these products rolled out globally by the end 
of this year. 
 
On the ground, we're building the airports of the future in some of the most important markets and adding new 
Delta Sky Clubs to provide our customers a world-class airport experience. We completed our transformation at 
Los Angeles 18 months ahead of schedule including a state-of-the-art facility and a new Delta Sky Club that was 
named North America's Best Airline Lounge for 2023 by Business Traveler. We opened the latest phase of our 
Salt Lake City expansion and will complete the generational rebuild of LaGuardia this year. 
 
Our digital investments continue as we work to increase our agility and provide employees with better tools and 
customers with a more seamless experience. Customers visited the Fly Delta App over 1 billion times last year, 
using our self-service tools almost 10 times more often than 2019, with much higher overall satisfaction.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
As 2024 begins, our enterprise has moved from a period of restoration to optimization. We are focused on 
delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the company to 
support continued growth in our earnings and our cash flow. 
 
We expect demand to remain strong, particularly for the premium experiences that Delta provides. Consumer 
spend is continuing to shift from goods to services and our customer base is in a healthy financial position with 
travel remaining a top priority, and corporate travel continues to improve with demand accelerating into year end. 
 
On supply, industry growth is normalizing after several years of network restoration. For 2024, we plan to grow 
Delta's capacity 3% to 5%, below the mid-single digit range that we discussed at our June Investor Day as we've 
refined our plan. 
 
Domestically, supply and demand are coming into better balance as the industry adjusts to rising cost of 
production and we are seeing a positive inflection in domestic unit revenue growth. Internationally, we expect 
another strong year as we optimize our network and leverage our global JV partners. 
 
With that backdrop, we are providing full-year 2024 guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow 
of $3 billion to $4 billion. Free cash guidance is up to $2 billion higher than 2023, driven by growth and 
profitability, lower CapEx, and an improved mix of cash sales. As we continue to grow earnings and reduce debt, 
we will further reduce leverage and advance our balance sheet towards investment-grade metrics. Glen and Dan 
will provide more details shortly including our outlook for the March quarter. 
 
In closing, the people of Delta delivered a remarkable 2023, leading the industry operationally and financially 
while providing a world-class experience for our customers. Delta is well positioned to build on our momentum in 
the new year, with continued growth in earnings, and cash flow in 2024. 
 
I could not be more excited about what's ahead for Delta and our customers and I am confident that our return-
focused strategy will drive significant value creation for our owners in the years to come. 
 
Thank you again for the support you show to our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work 
and dedication this year. 
 
For the full-year we delivered record revenues of $55 billion, about 20% higher than pre-pandemic. Strong 
execution on our commercial strategy resulted in significant outperformance against the industry. With 
international delivering record margins and profits, we finished the year with unit revenues 3% higher than 2022, 
also about 20% above pre-pandemic levels. 
 
Diversified revenue streams including Premium and Loyalty generated 55% of revenue reflecting Delta's 
differentiated strategy. Premium led all year with record paid load factors and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin. 
The rollout of Delta Premium Select on long-haul international is nearly complete and the revenue generation has 
been above our expectations. As we continued to increase our premium seat mix and segment the cabin through 
our five product strategy we have structurally improved the international margins.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Our Loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2023. Total 
Loyalty revenue was up 19% over the prior year with 15% growth in co-brand spend and increasing mix of 
premium cards in our AmEx Co-Branded portfolio. 
 
In recognition of our commitment to the Business Traveler, Delta was named number one in Business Travel 
News Airline survey for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Delta gained corporate share during the year 
and successfully launched SkyMiles for Business providing small- to medium-sized companies new benefits to 
support further growth in the important SME segment. Corporate sales accelerated into year-end including 
double-digit year-over-year growth in the month of December. 
 
Technology and Financial Services led this momentum for the December quarter, with Media and Auto sectors 
seeing notable traction following the strike resolutions. December quarter revenue was a record $13.7 billion, 11% 
higher than 2022. While unit revenues were 3% lower than last year, we are entering the year with momentum in 
our highest – and had experienced our highest cash sales day in history this week. We expect March quarter 
revenue growth of 3% to 6% over 2023 on capacity growth of 6% which includes 1 point from Lead Day implying 
unit revenues will be flat-to-down 3% over last year. This is a 2-point sequential improvement on a year-over-year 
basis from the December quarter. 
 
Our March quarter faces headwinds from three dynamics when compared to last year. These include higher 
international mix, normalization of travel credit utilization, and lapping a competitor's operational challenges. 
Looking through these headwinds, the core fundamentals of the business are improving faster than the headline 
numbers suggest. With encouraging developments in the domestic environment we expect domestic unit 
revenues to inflect to positive in the March quarter. 
 
The Transatlantic, our oldest international entity, continues to perform well with strong demand through the 
shoulder period and we expect unit revenues to grow in the March quarter. In Latin and Pacific, we are rebuilding 
our networks and improving connectivity with our JV partners, accounting for the majority of capacity growth in the 
March quarter. These investments are supporting higher short-term profitability but with lower unit revenues. 
 
Turning to our outlook for the full-year. Premium consumer trends remains strong and spending on travel 
experiences continues to outpace overall GDP by 2 to 3 points. We expect solid growth in business demand with 
nearly 95% of respondents in our recent corporate survey expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q. 
This is a double-digit improvement in travel intentions from our last survey. 
 
Our commercial strategy in 2024 builds on Delta's competitive advantages by optimizing our network, growing 
high-margin revenue streams and investing in our future. First, we have a unique opportunity to further optimize 
Delta's network to capitalize our strengths in core hubs and JV partner hubs, and reflect evolving travel trends. 
This is the first time we've been able to optimize since pre-pandemic as we now have a good set of demand to 
optimize from. 
 
Second, growing revenue diversification through higher-margin sources remains an important differentiator for 
Delta. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, further improve our 
retail capabilities and expand Loyalty revenues in travel adjacent services. We expect American Express 
remuneration to grow 10% over 2023 levels. 
 
Finally, we are investing in the future to enhance the premium travel experience through our next-gen fleet, 
generational airport builds and digital transformation. With continued investment Delta's brand strength and 
leadership position will extend in the years ahead.

In closing, I'm incredibly proud of the team's performance in 2023 and we're entering the new year with 
momentum. I'm excited about Delta's opportunities to grow our lead in 2024. 
 
And with that I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. 
 
2023 was another meaningful milestone in restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $6.25 per 
share and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, nearly double our performance of last year. Operating margin of 11.6% 
was up 4 points from last year and expected to lead the industry. We generated operating cash flow of $7.2 
billion, enabling reinvestment in our people, our fleet and technology. After gross CapEx of $5.3 billion, we 
generated free cash flow of $2 billion. 
 
During the year we paid more than $4 billion of gross debt. This included accelerated repayment of $1.7 billion of 
higher cost debt. We ended the year with liquidity of $6.8 billion and grew our unencumbered assets to $26 billion. 
Our leverage ratio improved two turns to finish the year at 3 times. Return on invested capital improved to 13.4%, 
up 5 points over 2022. 
 
S&P upgraded our credit rating in the second half of last year. We are investment-grade rated at Moody's and we 
are now only one notch away from investment-grade with outlooks improving at both S&P and Fitch during the 
year. With this progress, we reinstated our dividend last summer, broadening our appeal to yield-focused 
investors. 
 
We closed out the year strong, reporting a December quarter pre-tax profit of $1.1 billion on operating margins of 
9.7% resulting in earnings of $2.28 (sic) [$1.28] (00:17:36) per share. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.1% year-over-
year in line with our guidance. 
 
Now moving to our outlook. For the March quarter we expect earnings of $0.25 to $0.50 per share on 
approximately 5% operating margin. We expect March quarter fuel price to be $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon, with a 
$0.05 to $0.10 refinery benefit. The refinery profit is expected to be down more than $130 million from last year 
due to elevated crack spread in early 2023. 
 
For the full-year, we expect to deliver earnings of $6 to $7 per share. With our reduced outlook for capacity 
growth, we expect full-year non-fuel unit costs to be up low-single digit over 2023, with the March quarter unit 
costs up approximately 3%. 
 
The last two years were a period of intense restoration with unnatural high growth to rebuild our network. Growth 
is normalizing and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs 
and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. 
 
The intensity of hiring and training has moderated and investment and reliability are beginning to pay off with 
continued improvement in operational performance. We expect to deliver efficiencies through the year that will 
help fund investments in our people, the customer experiences that Ed spoke to earlier.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
On maintenance, we have a higher number of heavy airframe and engine checks this year resulting from the 
timing of new aircraft deliveries over the last decade and the reactivation of our flex fleets. At the same time, 
industry-wide supply chain constraints are continuing, driving higher-cost and extended turnaround times. 
 
For the full-year, we expect maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we prioritize continued 
improvement in operational reliability and readying our fleet for the peak summer period. We expect the majority 
of this increase to be in the early part of the year. 
 
Unit cost growth is expected to improve for the March quarter levels as we deliver efficiency and lap investments 
we made in the second half of 2023. 
 
Now, on to cash flow. We expect cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow including CapEx of $5 billion. 
The improvement in free cash flow is driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx and a higher mix of cash 
sales, as cash sales are expected to compose a larger percentage of overall bookings as travel credit utilization 
normalizes. 
 
We plan to pay cash for $3 billion of 2024 debt maturities and for approximately 45 aircraft deliveries, growing our 
unencumbered asset base to $30 billion. We expect to reduce leverage to under 3 times, returning the balance 
sheet to investment-grade metrics, while continuing to invest in the business remains our focus for capital 
allocation. We'll continue to evaluate shareholder returns with a focus on dividend growth as we reach our 
targeted leverage. 
 
In closing, Delta is well positioned as we enter the final year of our three-year plan to restore our financial 
foundation. We are continuing to prioritize the objectives we laid out at Investor Day with an emphasis on 
earnings durability, free cash flow and capital efficiency. Our industry-leading operational and financial 
performance is result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what 
they do every day. 
 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Oh, hey. Good morning, everyone. This is a question probably to both Dan and Glen. With the new A350-1000s 
coming in 2026 and knowing that you do have some additional Airbus widebodies delivering over the next few 
years, are you still going to be in a situation where maybe you have to extend your 767 fleet? I know that that is to 
be fully retired I think it was going to be by 2025. Will you have enough lift, and if not, are we going to see 
additional investments into maybe some of these older aircraft to keep them running through until you take 
deliveries of the bigger airplanes? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
As we move through 2025 – 2024 through the back half of the decade, we expect to retire the 767-300s through 
that period of time on a pretty consistent basis as you step through while continuing to fly the 400s. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Oh, so that – so you'll continue to fly the 400s beyond 2025, Dan? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Mike, I don't think... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Never in 2025... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
...it was never our intent to have those fleet grounded by 2025. It was our intent to have them out of international 
long-haul by 2028 and retired by 2030. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
2030, yeah.

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Okay. Okay. Makes sense. They're a bit younger. And then, Glen, just my second question. What was the 
headwind due to the cancelation of the Israel services in the fourth quarter, and is that a good way to think about 
the March quarter impact if you don't restart those services by the 31st? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
So, Mike, the initial hit was clearly the greatest, because as we moved through the quarter we redeployed the 
assets to other markets. So I would say it was about a point of revenue in 4Q and that really goes to very little 
impact in 1Q and beyond. And, of course, we're assessing the issues in Israel. Our current intent we have loaded 
for sale, April. We'll see how that manifests as we move through. But our priority is always safety first, safety of 
our customers and our crews, and that's going to be our priority. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Okay. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Oh, thanks very much, operator. Hey, team, thanks for the time. So two questions. One for, I think, Ed, you 
mentioned this morning on CNBC that you were seeing improvement in corporate especially in the tech sector. So 
I'm kind of wondering if you or Glen can talk about what you're seeing in corporate by sector and maybe by 
geographic region? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'll start, and Glen can add his color as well. We are seeing continued improvement in the corporate sector, 
and we had a number of laggards, tech being by far the largest in terms that had essentially not returned to travel 
and we're finally starting to see tech companies traveling again. And again, I think a lot of it is due to return to 
office, that is driving some of that. The consultancies as well which have also been laggards, again given their 
clients have had their offices somewhat reduced office hours. Opening is helping there. And we've seen it across 
the board. 
 
The other thing I mentioned this morning also is the auto and entertainment sectors have rebounded nicely. 
Entertainment clearly and the auto is starting to rebound following the strikes in the fourth quarter. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up question. As you think about international, I noticed 
that in your schedules you're elongating the season with maybe just January and February in international being 
seasonally lower. Are you seeing travel move into those months as well so that you would extend or add 
especially to your coastal hubs more international service going east?

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Absolutely. I think we've disclosed this previously is that we've seen the seasons elongate for leisure travel to 
Europe and really March through October now is pretty strong. Of course, the shoulder is still not as strong as the 
peak summer, but in response to that, and again, this is part of our optimization of how we fly is tailoring our 
capacity to when demand actually exists.

Oh, good morning, everybody. Glen, on the pending inflection in domestic RASM, I appreciate we're seeing 
capacity plans tighten up across the industry. My question is whether you're seeing any revisions in how the 
growth year airlines are behaving outside of nearly cutting capacity. Anything else interestingly we should be 
focused on, or is it simply a supply exercise that's driving the improvement? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think, Jamie, you've got a couple of contributors to it. One is what Ed just mentioned, the improving conditions in 
the corporate environment. And it's been a slow and steady rebuild since the end of the pandemic but we are at 
post pandemic highs somewhere right around 90% restored to pre-pandemic levels as we head into this year, so 
that I think is an exciting backdrop for a domestic turnaround. Of course, we have some of the rationalization of 
capacity but we also have continued improvements through segmentation and pricing. 
 
I can't talk to our competitors. I just know how we are working now and 20 years ago we were only worried about 
the lowest fares in the market and now we're worried about the entire ladder and the relativity within those ladders 
and trying to get people to experience the higher-quality product. And I think that's really led to our ability to 
continue to segment the customers in a more enlightened way moving forward. And that's going to be one of the 
key drivers as we head through this year.

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. I appreciate that. And then a second question for Ed. During your interview with Phil this morning, you 
mentioned you're still holding out hope for the $7 earnings outcome this year. If we fast forward to a year from 
today, give or take, and that indeed has been the outcome. What do you think the primary driver will have been? I 
guess, better way to ask is, do you think there's upside based on what Delta can control or do you think it'll simply 
be exogenous factors like, hey, fuel cooperated or I don't know, maybe the consumer leaned even further into 
premium, that sort of thing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure. Thanks, Jamie. I get the question. I think the level of volatility that we see is what causes us to be a bit 
cautious and prudent in giving that $6 to $7 EPS guide in 2024. We've been signaling that a bit for the last six 
months, and that's where we sit today. I have great confidence in us hitting that guide which is what I think the 
Street wants to know where our confidence level is. 
 
There are a bunch of macros that we look at into the year, which will help to see how they play out. Clearly, the 
geopolitical front continues to be quite testy, including the fact that this is a politically election season, not just in 
the US but around the world. Energy prices, we saw this morning just how volatile energy prices are. And to me, 
the supply chain, both the cost and the constraints that we see in this industry continue unabated. We're not 
making nearly the progress on the supply chain improvements. If anything, every news we get seems to be a bit 
worse, not better. So that constrains growth and increases cost. 
 
That all said, my internal stretch for myself and our team is to still get to that $7 number this year. I think we have 
a possibility to get there. But I also think that the macro weighs on that assessment. And I think to be prudent, we 
should set expectations maybe a little bit lower and hope to overachieve, just, by the way, we did in 2023. We 
gave a $5 to $6 guide and came in on the top-end, and I'd like to see a year from now that we're reporting that 
same type of result.

Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just on the regions in general, you obviously sound more constructive domestically, but 
I think you mentioned that you still see a lot – a fair bit of upside in terms of international. If you could just level set 
on your overall like regional expectations in 2024, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think we're expecting domestic to improve. The comps get easier as we move through the year so we should 
see some nice momentum there. We had a fantastic year in the Transatlantic. We're hoping to beat that, but 
there's a really high bar as we move through the year. What we have on the books today is really pretty exciting 
for the month of April where we have about 40% of our Transatlantic bookings in place. We have unit revenues 
sitting at high-single digits up, which I think most people wouldn't expect. Of course, we have a lot of booking to 
go there, but the early returns for spring and summer are very favorable as we sit today. 
 
Pacific, where we have an incredible amount of capacity, it's being absorbed nicely and we expect that to inflect 
into a positive territory as those growth rates come down, we move through the year. And last but not least, Latin, 
and our ambitious build of South America with our partners LATAM is paying very strong dividends. We're 
improving our profitability albeit at lower unit revenue. So I think we're very excited about where South America 
sits and the beaches this winter seem a little oversaturated, that will rationalize itself out as we move through the 
year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Appreciate that. And then, Dan, on 2024 costs, I was hoping if you could provide some thought just on the shape 
of the cost trajectory. It seems like a lot of it just has to do with timing of maintenance and really that type of stuff, 
so just any color – additional color on that could be helpful. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. Maintenance was up $350 million for the year with a focus on the first part of the year. The other piece of it 
is, if you think about efficiencies, efficiencies just build as you progress through the year. One example is we're 
down on – we're fully staffed but one place we're hiring is pilots. That will be down 50% – over 50% from last year. 
But again, front half centric with trading associated with it as you get ready for the summer and that really 
normalizes the historical levels in the back half of the year. So just a good, steady drumbeat of efficiencies as we 
pace through the year.

Stephen Darrell Trent 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. This might be for Ed or Glen. But, you 
addressed it a little bit in an earlier response. But, how did you think the supply chain stuff goes? First, we have 
the GTF engine. Now the MAX 9 door plug. Do you think we've kind of reached the bottom or are you concerned 
there could be more to come 6 to 12 months from now?

Thanks, Stephen. This is Ed. I hope there's no more surprises, but I'd be lying to you if I thought that's the case. I 
think we're continuing to work through in this post pandemic world, the implications of the supply chain issues that 
we saw, and the MAX 9 issue is a one-off – a separate issue, I'm not referring to that. I am referring principally to 
the engine side of the business and there's a lot of work on Pratt. We have a lot of reliance on Pratt, and their 
challenges that they're facing have been well-chronicled. 
 
One of the things that we see on the engine side is there's a lot of the incremental resources that our engine 
providers and suppliers have put their resources against, it also strips away resources from maintenance work on 
their existing business with us. So we're working through in as efficient a manner with Pratt, in this weekend we 
spent a lot of time with them. Rolls and GE, everybody in the engine world has challenges not just on the original 
build but more importantly, on the parts and the repair side of the business. And a lot of it's inexperienced factory 
level, all the suppliers in our industry lost a tremendous amount of experience due to the pandemic and have 
taken time to get that back, to get the turn times down to where they need to be and we have higher turn times 
that not only delays the entry into service, it also causes costs to go up. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Darrell Trent 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
I appreciate that, Ed. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I appreciate as well what you mentioned on the Latin 
market doing well. Any high-level color with respect to sort of deep LATAM versus short-haul LATAM? I mean, I 
presume a lot of the uplift you're seeing is from the – the JBA is spooling up but just wanted to make sure I 
understood that correctly. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. So, I think you described it perfectly. There's a little pressure on the short-haul Latin particularly on the 
resorts where a lot of capacity was added by the industry year-over-year but we're having really incredible 
performance into deep South America as we continue our coordination of launching the JV with LATAM and we're 
very excited about the short-term and the long-term prospects there.

David Vernon 
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q 
Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Dan, as you think about what happened in 
2023 as far as kind of the cost creep that led us to a little bit of a higher-cost position than maybe you would have 
thought in the beginning of the year. Can you give us kind of rundown around what you missed in 2023, and then 
with that as kind of a backdrop, talk to some of the sources of risk that you might see for that low-single digit 
outlook for CASM-Ex in 2024?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Yeah. Predominantly, yes, David, certainly. Two drivers. First, we flew less capacity and kept the cost into – 
invest back into the business. That was one. And the second piece was, what we talked a lot in the second half of 
the year was the investment in maintenance and the cost associated with maintenance and those were really 
when you look at where we were from what we guided to, where we ended up just over plus two. Those were the 
single two biggest drivers associated with that. 
 
When you think about that as we go into new year [ph] – four here (00:39:02), a lot different backdrop as we're in 
a more normalized growth environment. When you're thinking and planning and the teams are executing to 3% to 
5% growth versus 17% to 20% growth, the focus really less on this training and hiring and the restoration of the 
airline and our operating teams are focused on the operational performance and fine-tuning that. And as you do 
that, that sets the stage to drive the efficiency. 
 
And things that – actions that we took in 2023 are paying off. If you look at the maintenance, doing a lot of work 
and there's a lot to still go. But the fourth quarter performance, aircraft out of service down 30%, maintenance 
cancels down over 80%. So those actions that they're taking around proactive reliability, getting the touch time on 
the aircraft [indiscernible] (00:40:00) but that's really what allows us when you're in that normalized environment, 
you can really stay after that consistently day in and day out. That sets the stage for the execution around 
efficiency. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
David, if I could jump in here. It's hard to overstate just how hard it was to bring the full business back up again 
over the last two-and-a-half years. And the intensity of that has been phenomenal and our team's done a great job 
and has taken every fiber of our being in hiring and resource we have to try to get ahead of it. We're there now. 
Okay? And you see the results in the fourth quarter. They were remarkable. The best fourth quarter operational 
results I think this company has ever posted. And that is, I think, the big opportunity as we enter the year. 
 
I don't know that we know yet just how much we have available to us as we start to return to a normalized 
environment, we started tweaking those efficiencies. I think it's going to be significant. And it's kind of hard to 
forecast because this team has been for the last two-plus years in a very different part of the build, but I'm 
confident we're going to see some great opportunities. And that's – to Jamie's earlier question, some of my 
internal expectations of hoping we can get to that $7 above EPS number. Unwilling to put that number on paper 
quite yet, but, yeah, I think the opportunity is there. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q 
Thanks for that added color. Just to maybe kind of follow up on that point a little bit. As you think about the 
optimization of efficiency gains that are ahead of you. I appreciate that it's hard to quantify at all, but can you give 
us a sense for what the driver of some of these things are, kind of big picture wise? Is it about utilization of 
aircraft? Is it about getting the staffing optimized or is it more about just working some of the friction costs in the 
business out and – so they're continuously improving, chasing down a bunch of little dogs and cats across the 
business. I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what are we looking at here? Are we looking at a large set of 
projects or are they one or two things that are going to be super-pivotal around the optimization plan then.

David, I think it's all of the above. And it's not just what you mentioned on the cost side, it's also on the revenue 
side. Consumer behaviors have changed a lot and to this point, we've been using somewhat older models to 
predict behavioral patterns. And we now have actually a good baseline over the last year-and-a-half of how 
consumers are purchasing, what they're purchasing, when they want to travel, which Glen and his team will use to 
drive better network and revenue outcomes for our business. It's in the cost line. 
 
In fact, we have 10% more employees today than we had at this point pre-pandemic, essentially driving the same 
level of operations, tremendous amount of opportunity to get efficient. But when the operators know what they can 
count on and they've got their arms around the full operation, I think you're going to see the cash register start to 
ring with cost and savings efficiencies. So, I know it's a [indiscernible] (00:43:20) a little bit but I'm optimistic we'll 
get there. But it's really hard to quantify at the same time.

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Thanks. Good morning, and Happy New Year, everyone. I know your commentary on demand sounds pretty 
good, but can you unpack a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in the forward booking curve through spring 
break. Maybe even the activity through like the Paris Olympics, so what the summer kind of – what kind of 
forward indicator do you have that people might be traveling more? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think I've mentioned it as a response to one of the other questions, but we have pretty good visibility on the 
early bookings for the summer Transatlantic season and we have a higher booked load factor as well as higher 
yield. So those are the two things we watch for and both are indicating quite positive for the Transatlantic. 
 
The US has, of course, a closer-in booking curve but as far as we can see out through spring break things look 
great for the US. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the closed-in beach resorts have a little bit too much 
industry capacity this year that'll probably get rationalized out over time, but still we'll be very profitable as we 
move through the peak winter season. And then as the Pacific – as we continue to lap the buildup of our Pacific 
as we move through the year, we expect those unit revenues to accelerate demand, particularly strong to the 
Incheon hub as well as to Japan and the spring season, so very exciting as we look forward. I hope we can outdo 
our plan. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Got it. And apologies if I missed this earlier but do you – I mean, some of your peers are having issues with 
potential extended grounding of some aircraft for inspections. Do you see any kind of spillover benefit for that in 
the short-term and kind of – is any of that in your 1Q guidance?

We've seen minimal improvements in – what we have seen is mostly in Seattle where they had to cancel a 
significant portion of their schedule out of Seattle. But we'll see how long that stays out. But right now I wouldn't 
say it's a significant number in the grander scheme of things. It's significant for Seattle but not significant for our 
whole network.

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on the cadence of the non-op savings and the component drivers of that. Is it 
spread pretty evenly throughout the year or is it more kind of second half weighted? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. So, the drivers, $75 million to $100 million really driven by interest expense and as we've accelerated the 
debt reduction action, that drives the benefit. We expect pension to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The team 
did a great job. The pension delivered at or slightly above its targeted return, so no headwind associated with that. 
You get some – a little bit around some of the equity earnings of our partners, but we expect to be pretty 
consistent throughout the year due to the interest reduction and savings coming through as you progress through 
the year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Glen. You've done a nice job, taken active steps to – on the capacity 
sequentially 4Q to 1Q. But could you just speak to seasonality and maybe by entity, where is seasonality a lot 
different than it used to be? Where is it kind of normalized? So any key trends you'd highlight in change in the 
underlying seasonal patterns here into the first quarter. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think we're at our new norm, and our new norm is different than 2019, but what I see mainly is an 
extension of the international seasons. So, we mentioned that in an earlier question that it used to be the summer 
of peak was just June, July, August, and now I think we're moving into a April through March all the way through 
October as a very strong season particularly for Southern Europe. Northern Europe starts a little bit later. 
 
And then the other thing I'd just mention, I mentioned in an earlier call as well is that, the beach – the Mexican and 
the Caribbean beaches just seem to have a little bit too much capacity this year, and we'll work through that as we 
go through the year. But it's – if you look, those are up 20% to 30% across the board, and having little trouble

keeping up with that – the demand keeping up with that kind of capacity increase and I'd imagine it is people plan 
next year that [ph] will trim on the margin goes back (00:48:23) down again or let that demand catch up. 
 
So generally, I think we're in a good spot here with supply and demand as far as the eye can see. We're positive 
in all the future months and almost all the future, in almost every entity with the exception of Latin.

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, to Ed or Dan, I mean, looking back 
from your prior 2021 targets, you guys are guiding at the top-end here to effectively reach that. And I think not a 
lot of people give you credit. So that's the context of my question. But that said, valuation in your stock, still pretty 
low. I think investors are just concerned that we've seen peak airline profitability. And your guidance would 
effectively say about flat profitability this year, in 2024 versus 2023. So maybe coming back to some of these prior 
questions. What is in your control that can get profitability higher, maybe looking beyond this year that can give 
investors comfort that this business should be earning mid-teens. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thanks, Brandon, and you're right. When you think about when we set that target it was in December of 2021. I'll 
never forget we were at the Exchange, I believe you were there, and Omicron was just being announced, the 
newest variant. So the level of knowledge we had to the future and where this thing was going it was candidly 
kind of maybe a bit crazy for us to put out a three-year plan, but I thought it was really important and constructive 
for us as well as our investors to let them see how we're thinking about the progress. And the great news is 
through the first two years we are at if not ahead of plan along that way. And I think if I was to go back and say 
what has changed that maybe has given me a little bit of pause for $7, not longer term but just in the short term, I 
think it's the higher cost of labor, certainly was not known back then. The higher inflation rates were not known 
back then. And most importantly, the supply chain constraints. The full extent were clearly not known. I had no 
knowledge of the challenges we faced. 
 
So when you think about all the macros we encountered, I think we've done a very good job of controlling those 
things that we can control. And as you've heard from several of the questions, I still internally am targeting us to 
get to that $7 number this year and I think we can. I really do, but I think it's also prudent that we give a nod to 
some of those macros that we're facing. I think the optimization opportunities as I mentioned are significant and 
they run across every single part of this business and all of our leaders are working hard to ensure that we're 
delivering an excellent quality product which unleashes that optimization of benefits. 
 
I think the work that we're doing on the balance sheet with all of the debt reduction is – de-risking and taking that 
down is important. We're on track with our free cash flow guidance, $3 billion to $4 billion this year and we're still 
looking at a $10 billion target between 2023 and 2025 for free cash.

So I think there's a – you're right, there's a lot of noise that "we're lowering guidance," I don't really look at it that 
way. I think it's giving nod to some of the macro realities and wanted to give you a prudent estimate to what we 
are confident we can deliver this year with a nod towards there's some real upside here. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Thank you for that, Ed. And then Dan, the maintenance issues have been present now for probably over a year, if 
not longer. I guess, what are you doing longer term planning to maybe mitigate that? And is there any favorable 
offset longer term here in your MRO business? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
One is, we continue as we get into a period here where we're more normalized in growth. It's allowing us to 
extend our planning horizon where we're able to look out on a rolling not only 12 months but 18, 24, 36 months 
and I think the more visibility and stability that we get from that allows us to better plan as it relates back into how 
we run our fleet and how we balance that capacity with cost. And I think that will continue to give us more 
certainty around that. 
 
The other piece is just the heavy lift that our entire TechOps team has in working closely with the supply chain, 
and with all our partners across that getting clarity in regards to the things that they need to do and we can do on 
their behalf as it relates to Delta in regards to continue to improve the execution of that over time and we've got to 
work closely with those partners to continue to improve that. 
 
And then to last piece on MRO, yes, there will be an opportunity to continue to grow. I think as we've talked about 
before, we're well positioned on all these platforms. The focus has been and will be right here, making sure that 
we've got strong foundation on Delta and Delta's fleet, but we also do have an eye to continue to grow the MRO 
business and you'll start to see that start this year but really in earnest in the years two and three years out.

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, Bank of America Securities Q 
Hi. Good morning, everyone. So a question for Glen. I think you started ramping up your core hub growth in the 
middle of 2023. Is there any way you can quantify maybe what the benefits of this build-out were to your revenue 
performance over the back half and what share of your capacity growth this year will be growth in these hubs? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think we just eluded to a majority of our growth will be in our core hubs, or to partner hubs. So probably 75% to 
80% of our growth will be in those locations. We feel that we accelerated the coastal gateway growth earlier in the 
process...

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
....with our once in a lifetime opportunities to become the leading carriers in markets like Los Angeles and Boston, 
and those are paying huge dividends for us as we head into 2024 with Boston, for example, leading the unit 
revenue ascension for this quarter. So we're really, really pleased with the way it shaked out and we still have 
some more rebuild to do in our core hubs. It'll probably take us through this year and into next year given the 
lower growth rates that we have, but that's what we're working on for the next 18 to 24 months. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, Bank of America Securities Q 
Got it. That's helpful. And then just, Dan, in the $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, are you assuming any sort 
of cash taxes this year or – when do you expect to become a cash taxpayer? I thought it was a number of years 
out but just curious if there's any update there. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, we don't expect cash taxes this year, and we expect that potentially cash tax payments starting in 2025 and 
beyond. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora

Thank you.

Matthew, we'll go to our final analyst question before then going over to the media.

Operator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Savvy Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a quick one for me, just you talked about pilot – hiring being down 50% 
year-over-year and you've heard similar comments from the industry. Just curious what that means for your 
regional operation and if that is much of a drag in 2023, either to cost or to revenue from that operation and what 
you can expect this year and next year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
So thanks for that question. And I think that plays well into some of the other themes that we've talked about of 
what are the potential upsides to our plan that can get you towards the $7. We had planned for stability in the 
regionals after two-and-a-half years of really instability where we didn't know how many hours we have really

three to four months ahead of time. And what we've seen is that there is a lot more stability. What we haven't 
accounted for is the full utilization of our fleet. So we still have 50 to 100 airplanes less of utilization than we have 
on the ground and in our fleet. So should that lower hiring at the mainline translating to more availability in the 
back half of the year that would be potential upside to our P&L. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Perfect. All right. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
All right. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media 
question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we can reiterate for the members of the media, the instructions with regard to 
accessing the call and follow-ups, please? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Ted Reed from Forbes. Your line 
is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ted Reed 
Reporter, Forbes Media LLC Q 
All right. Thanks for taking the question. It's for Glen. I just wondered if the Delta passenger in 2024 looks different 
than the passenger in 2023, and I'm also asking whether the age of revenge travel is over and – or we passed 
revenge travel. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I mean this is all an opinion, right, as revenge travel I think has years to go particularly in long-haul 
international. When you look at the aging of the demographics, that people in their retirement year want to travel 
and they were robbed of the ability to travel for three years and we weren't able to accommodate until our last 
year. I think that we continue the accommodation of that for the next couple years until that revenge travel 
catches up. I think domestically [indiscernible] (00:58:42) revenge travel was earlier in the process and we're kind 
of in our new equilibrium and that gives us the opportunity to optimize as we move forward. And, do they look 
different? They always look different. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ted Reed 
Reporter, Forbes Media LLC Q 
As for destinations, are we more in the unique – is it more unique Transatlantic that they're looking at or more the 
traditional Transatlantic or something else?

I think it's more of a traditional. Italy, Spain, those are two of the – Italy, Spain, Greece are fresh hotspots. 
Portugal is a hotspot. And I think during the peak summer we're really excited about the prospect to bring SAS 
along with us and now having hubs in Copenhagen and Stockholm that will allow us to have even more 
destinations in Europe than we serve today.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from Atlanta-Journal Constitution. 
Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kelly Yamanouchi 
Reporter, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution Q 
Thanks. Ed, you mentioned having 10% more employees today than pre-pandemic and essentially driving the 
same level of operations and the opportunities to get efficient. I was wondering if that means growing operations 
with the same number of employees or potentially cutting the staffing level. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Kelly. No, there's no plans to cut staffing levels at all. This is about our people being able to garner more 
experience because a lot of the new employees that we've added over the last few years are adding to that 10% 
and continuing to be a bit more efficient in productivity and the staffing levels. But no, we have no intention to 
make any reductions in people. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kelly Yamanouchi 
Reporter, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution Q 
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Wondering if you're seeing increased bookings since United and Alaska have had to 
ground their MAX 9. And then separately, maybe this is a question more for Glen, but do you think you're done 
with the measures that you had to take last year in terms of the SkyMiles program and lounges to sort of combat 
crowding since this year is going to be so busy and if you have enough premium seats to offer the market 
currently? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'll take the second question first is we made some serious changes to our programs that were designed to 
really put the right people in the right categories so that we could deliver industry-leading premium experiences.

And as you know, while they were announced in the fall, most of them don't take into effect until 2025. And I think 
what we've estimated is that should – we should be done with that – those kinds of major changes to our 
programs. Of course, those programs are always changing, but I think the changes moving forward will be much 
more minimal. So I think that's behind us. We'll see how that plays out by the end of this year and into 2025. 
 
And your other question was... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
MAX. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Oh, the MAX, yes... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs

On your bookings – oh, yeah. And... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We've seen a – we've seen a small... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
...since the grounding. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We've seen a small uptick specifically in Seattle, but Seattle is a small portion of our entire system, so it's kind of 
minimal in the grander scheme of things but it's relevant in Seattle.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Thank you. I was wondering, do you still think Delta still has the same advantage over rivals just in terms of 
reliability and its operation and is that something that you're kind of working on. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Ali. This is Ed. The one thing that we've seen over the last couple of years which has been great for customers 
is that the overall reliability in the industry has improved and carriers increasingly are competing over operational 
performance rather than other – some other things in the past that people may have been focused against, and I 
think that's great. And I think it pushes us to be even better, and I think it's a great outcome for the industry as a 
whole. So, yes, the competition is definitely more focused on reliability than ever before, and I still expect Delta to 
maintain its premium lead in that sector... 
 
[indiscernible] (01:03:28) 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
And then if I could ask about sort of labor shortages. Are you concerned at all or starting to feel the impact of the 
shortage of maintenance workers? Is that something you expect to come to a head this year? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We are not experiencing any issues around the labor shortages. Maybe very small isolated places we still have 
some additional people we'd like to bring in. But we are at where we need to be. And for us it's less about the 
shortages. It's more about the new people that we've brought on continuing to gain experience and that's a big 
deal particularly in the maintenance area. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert Silk 
Reporter, Travel Weekly Q 
Hello. Good morning. Glen, you've mentioned that you gained corporate share this year. I wonder if you could 
elaborate on what caused that you think, how you gained it and if there was any – some of it might have come 
from the removing of fares from the traditional GDS channel by other – your main competitors.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 12-Jan-2024 
 
Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think one of the issues where we were very inventory constrained in 2022 as we were behind the industry 
in our rebuild. And in 2023, we caught up back to basically our pre-pandemic level of capacity and those 
additional seats were – enabled more corporates to get on the aircraft. 
 
I'd say what's different about now versus pre-pandemic is that before the pandemic and before the segmentation 
of customers, the differential between the yields on corporate and the yields on non-corporate high end leisure 
were significant and these days those are closed. So now you have competition for the premium seats between 
those two categories that didn't exist pre-pandemic. And that's exciting for us as we manage them. But I think 
getting more seats available is one of the key priorities in the premium sector, so that we can accommodate all 
the demand. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert Silk 
Reporter, Travel Weekly Q 
Okay. What about seeing any sort of share shift based upon your strategy of leaving all your fares available in the 
traditional EDIFACT GDS. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. Clearly, we think that our strategy is more customer-friendly and I'm sure that's part of it, but we don't want 
to buy it. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert Silk 
Reporter, Travel Weekly Q 
Okay. Thank you.
