Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s earnings press release, 
and in our annual report on form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking statements that we make 
on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these 
statements as a result of new information or future events. 
 
During this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of 
GAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The earnings press release 
and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. 
 
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark. 
 
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO 
 
Thanks Ken, and hey everyone -- thanks for joining. 
 
It's been a good start to the year -- both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We 
estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day, and we're seeing 
healthy growth in the US. I want to call out WhatsApp specifically, where the number of daily actives 
and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've 
also made good progress on our AI and metaverse efforts, and that's where I’m going to focus most of 
my comments today. 
 
So let's start with AI. We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant 
that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their 
communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on 
our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and 
development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more. 
 
Last week we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest 
model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and 
usage. 
 
The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback 
is very positive and, when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting 
was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are. We've started launching Meta AI 

1 
 



in some English‐speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming 
months. 
 
You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product 
to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it, and then once we think it's ready then 
we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release we're now 
moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the 
most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use. And now that we have the superior quality product, 
we're making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and 
Facebook. 
 
Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this 
release: Meta AI now creates animations from still images, and now generates high quality images so 
fast that it can create and update them as you're typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of 
people commenting about this experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything 
like it before. 
 
In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that’s powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 
3 has come together so far. The 8B and 70B parameter models that we released are best-in-class for 
their scale. The 400+B parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry-leading on 
several benchmarks. And I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source 
contributions. 
 
Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we 
have the talent, data, and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world’s leading AI models and 
services. And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to 
build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world. As we're scaling capex 
and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But 
realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our 
investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.  
 
I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of 
our product playbook ‐‐ where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We 
saw this with Reels, Stories, as News Feed transitioned to mobile and more. And I also expect to see a 
multi‐year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable 
services I expect as well. Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has 
been a very good long term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial 
signs are quite positive here too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the 
other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years. 
 
On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them 
effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business 
messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger 
AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app 
engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. 
So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive 
amounts of value for people and business for us over time. 
 

2 
 



We are seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on 
Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of 
years. And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram is now AI 
recommended. AI has also always been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing 
people more relevant ads, and if you look at our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ 
Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since 
last year. 
 
We're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. 
Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come 
from the open source community -- where improving cost efficiency is one of the main areas I expect 
that open sourcing will help us improve, similar to what we saw with Open Compute. We'll also keep 
making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta Training and Inference Accelerator chip 
has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations-related workloads on this less 
expensive stack, and as this program matures over the coming years we plan to expand this to more of 
our workloads as well. And of course as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully 
manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company. 
 
In addition to our work on AI, our other long term focus is the metaverse. It's been interesting to see 
how these two themes have come together. 
 
This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream 
product until we had full holographic displays -- and I still think that will be awesome and is mature state 
of the product. But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI 
glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see 
what you see and hear what you hear, so they have full context on what's going on around you as they 
help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with Vision on the glasses is 
a good example where you can now ask questions about things you're looking at. 
 
One strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work 
is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as if Family of Apps and 
Reality Labs were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them as fundamentally 
the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in 
large part so that way we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need 
to find better ways to articulate the value that’s generated here across both segments so it doesn't just 
seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales but all the value flows to a 
different segment. 
 
The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with Essilor Luxottica continue to do well and are sold out in 
many styles and colors, so we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we 
can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine, and in general, 
I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of 
options over time. If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different 
from phones or watches in that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach 
of partnering with leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market. 
 
I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the mixed reality headset market over 
time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built 

3 
 



to power Quest. As the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use 
mixed reality that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build. For example, a 
work-focused headset may be slightly less designed for motion but may want to be lighter by connecting 
to your laptop. A fitness-focused headset may be lighter with sweat-wicking materials. An 
entertainment-focused headset may prioritize the highest-resolution displays over everything else. A 
gaming-focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics, or a device that comes with Xbox 
controllers and a Game Pass subscription out of the box.  
 
To be clear, I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as 
we see today, and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it 
accessible to everyone. But I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system 
will help grow the ecosystem even faster. 
 
In addition to AI and the metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on 
some of the most important trends with WhatsApp growth in the US and AI-powered recommendations 
in our feeds and Reels already, but I wanted to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This 
month we launched an update full-screen video player on Facebook that brings together Reels, longer 
videos, and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system. On Instagram, 
Reels and video continue to drive engagement, with Reels alone now making up 50% of the time that’s 
spent within the app. 
 
Threads is growing well too. There are now more than 150M monthly actives, and it continues to 
generally be on the trajectory I hoped to see. My daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift 
is now on Threads -- that was a big deal in my house. 
 
Okay, that's what I wanted to cover today. I'm proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've 
got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to our teams 
driving all these advances, and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now, here is Susan. 
 
Susan Li, CFO 
 
Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.  
 
Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise 
noted. 
 
Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. 
 
Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. 
 
In terms of the specific line items: 
 
Cost of revenue increased 9%, as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping 
Reality Labs inventory-related valuation adjustments. 
 
R&D increased 6%, driven mostly by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which 
were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. 
 

4 
 



Marketing & Sales decreased 16%, due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and 
marketing spend. 
 
G&A increased 20%, as higher legal-related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. 
 
We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. 
 
First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. 
 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%.  
 
Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share. 
 
Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.7 billion, driven by 
investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. 
 
Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid 
$1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable 
securities and $18.4 billion in debt. 
 
Moving now to our segment results. 
 
I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. 
 
Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.2 billion people using 
at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. 
 
Q1 Total Family of Apps revenue was $36.0 billion, up 27% year over year. 
 
Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. 
 
Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, 
followed by gaming and entertainment and media. 
 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 
33%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%.  
 
In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20% and the average 
price per ad increased 6%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. 
 
Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression 
growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces. 
 
Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85%, driven by business messaging revenue 
growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform. 
 
We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our 
Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of 

5 
 



our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure 
costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. 
 
Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin. 
 
Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30% driven by Quest headset sales. 
Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount-related expenses 
were more than offset by lapping inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs.  
 
Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion.  
 
Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue 
performance: Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at 
monetizing that engagement over time.   
 
On the first - we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our 
product priorities. 
 
Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive 
incremental engagement on our platforms, demonstrating that people are finding added value by 
discovering content from accounts they’re not connected to. The level of recommended content in our 
apps has scaled as we’ve improved these systems, and we see further opportunity to increase the 
relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models. 
 
Video also continues to grow across our platform, and it now represents more than 60% of time on both 
Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth, and we’re progressing on our 
work to bring together Reels, longer-form video and Live video into one experience on Facebook. In 
April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the US and Canada, which is increasingly powered by 
our next generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video 
recommendations over time. 
 
We’re also introducing deeper integrations of generative AI into our apps in the US and more than a 
dozen other countries. Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use 
Meta AI in Search within our apps, as well as Feed and Groups on Facebook. We expect these 
integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people 
to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they’re 
interested in. 
 
Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the 
community. 
 
Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There are 
two parts to this work. 
 
The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here, we continue to advance our 
understanding of users’ preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place 
and person to show an ad to. For example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number 
of ads in real time, based on our perception of a user’s interest in ad content and to minimize disruption 

6 
 



from ads, as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going 
forward, while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization, like video and messaging, will serve 
as additional growth opportunities. 
 
The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to 
our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. 
 
First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for 
advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture, Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out 
more broadly last year. This new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize 
learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous, smaller ads models that have historically 
been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as 
we operate fewer models, but also improving ad performance. 
 
Another way we’re leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our 
Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign set up process - such as 
selecting which ad creative to show - or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end 
automation tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App ads. We’re seeing growing use of these 
solutions, and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we 
learn to our broader ads investments. 
 
Next, I’d like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.  
 
We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near-
term and capture significant longer-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop 
more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative 
AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to 
realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in 
infrastructure over the coming years. 
 
Our other long-term initiative that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. 
We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work. For 
example, with RayBan Meta smart glasses, people in the US & Canada can now use our multimodal 
Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone. Longer-term, we expect generative AI 
to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products, making it easier to develop immersive 
experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services 
as we transition to the next computing platform. 
 
We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline, and believe 
our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to 
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  

 
In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and 
regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial 
results. We also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the State of Texas regarding our 
use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss. 
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. 

7 
 



 
We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion. Our guidance 
assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current 
exchange rates. 
 
Turning now to the expense outlook. 
 
We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior 
outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to 
expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product 
development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. 
 
Turning now to the capex outlook. 
 
We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased 
from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to 
support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capex 
will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and 
product development efforts. 
 
On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the 
mid-teens. 
 
In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We’re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps 
and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the 
potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.  
 
With that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions. 
 
Operator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a 

question, please press star one on your touch tone phone. To withdraw your 
question, again press star one. Please limit yourself to one question. Please pick up 
your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming 
today's call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question comes 
from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 

 
Eric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe I'll ask a two-parter. Mark, you 

used the analogy of other investment cycles you've been through around products 
like Stories and Reels. 

 
 I know you're not giving long-term guidance today, but using those analogies, how 

should investors think about the length and depth of this investment cycle with 
respect to either AI and/or Reality Labs more broadly and mixed reality? 

 
 And you both talked about the impact AI is having on the advertising ecosystem. 

What are you watching for in terms of adoption or utility on the consumer side to 
know that AI adoption is tracking along with the investment cycle? Thank you. 

 

8 
 



Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. In terms of the timing, I think it's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from 
previous cycles. But I guess like the main thing that we see is that we will usually 
take, I don't know a couple of years, could be a little more, could be less, to focus on 
building out and scaling the products.  

 
 And we typically don't focus that much on monetization of the new areas until they 

reach significant scale because it's so much higher leverage for us just to improve 
monetization on other things before these new products are at scale. 

 
 So you enter this period where I think kind of smart investors see that the product is 

scaling and that there's a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the 
revenue materializes. And I think we've seen that with Reels and with Stories and 
with the shift to mobile and all these things, where basically, we build out the 
inventory first for a period of time and then we monetize it. 

 
 And during that time, when it's scaling, it’s -- sometimes it's not just the case that 

we're not making money from that thing. 
 
 It can often actually be the case that it displaces other revenue from other things. So 

like you saw with Reels, I mean it scaled and there was a period where it was not 
profitable for us as it was scaling before it became profitable. So I think that's more 
the analogy that I'm making on this. 

 
 But I think it's -- what that suggests is that what we should all be focused on for the 

next period is as the consumer products scale, Meta AI really just launched in a 
meaningful way so we don't have any kind of hard stats to share on that. 

 
 But I'd say that's the main thing that I'm focused on for this year and probably a lot 

of next year is growing that product and the other AI products and the engagement 
around them. And I think we should all have quite a bit of confidence that if those 
are on a good track to scale, then they're going to end up being very large 
businesses. So that's the main point that I was trying to make there. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. 

Please go ahead. 
 
Brian Nowak: Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on sort of the 

recommendation engine improvements and even, Susan, when you talked about 
further opportunities to increase the relevance of the models. 

 
 Could you just unpack that a little bit for us? Can you give us examples of where 

you're still running the model in a suboptimal basis or opportunities for improved 
signal capture use or data you're not using? Where are sort of the areas of 
improvement you see from here? 

 
 And then the second one, when you talk about driving incremental adoption of AI 

tools for advertisers, what are sort of some of the main gating factors you've 

9 
 



encountered to get advertisers to test these tools? And how do you think about sort 
of addressing that throughout '24 and '25? Thanks. 

 
Susan Li: Thanks, Brian. So to your first question, where are there more opportunities for us 

to leverage and improve our recommendations models to drive engagement. 
 
 One of the things I would say is, historically, each of our recommendation products 

including Reels, in-feed recommendations, et cetera, has had their own AI model. 
 
 And recently, we've been developing a new model architecture with the aim for it to 

power multiple recommendations products. 
 
 We started partially validating this model last year by using it to power Facebook 

Reels. And we saw meaningful performance gains, 8% to 10% increases in watch 
time, as a result of deploying this. 

 
 This year, we're actually planning to extend the singular model architecture to 

recommend content across not just Facebook Reels, but also Facebook's video tab 
as well. 

 
 So while it's still too early to share specific results, we're optimistic that the new 

model architecture will unlock increasingly relevant video recommendations over 
time. And if it's successful, we'll explore using it to power other recommendations. 

 
 An analog exists, I would say, on the ads side. We've talked a little bit about the new 

model architecture, Meta Lattice, that we deployed last year that consolidates 
smaller and more specialized models into larger models that can better learn what 
characteristics improve ad performance across multiple services, like Feed and Reels 
and multiple types of ads and objectives at the same time. And that's driven 
improved ad performance over the course of 2023 as we deployed it across 
Facebook and Instagram to support multiple objectives. 

 
 And over the course of 2024, we expect to further enhance model performance and 

include support for even more objectives like web and app and ROAS. 
 
 So there's a lot of work that we're investing in, in the underlying model architecture 

for both organic engagement and ads that we expect is going to continue to deliver 
increasing ads performance over time. 

 
 The second question you asked was around getting advertisers to test and adopt 

GenAI tools. There are two flavors of this. The more near-term version is around the 
GenAI ad creative features that we have put into our ads creation tools. And it's 
early, but we're seeing adoption of these features across verticals and different 
advertiser sizes. 

 
 In particular, we've seen outsized adoption of image expansion with small 

businesses, and this will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024, and I expect that 

10 
 



improvements to our underlying foundation models will enhance the quality of the 
outputs that are generated and support new features on the roadmap. 

 
 But right now we have features supporting text variations, image expansion, and 

background generation, and we're continuing to work to make those more 
performant for advertisers to create more personalized ads at scale. 

 
 The longer-term piece here is around business AIs. We have been testing the ability 

for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats 
with customers, starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to 
people asking for more information on a product or its availability. 

 
 So this is very, very early. We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on 

Messenger and WhatsApp, and we're hearing good feedback with businesses saying 
that the AIs have saved them significant time while customer -- consumers noted 
more timely response times.  

 
 And we're also learning a lot from these tests to make these AIs more performant 

over time as well. So, we'll be expanding these tests over the coming months, and 
we'll continue to take our time here to get it right before we make it more broadly 
available. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein Research. 

Please go ahead. 
 
Mark Shmulik: Yes, hi thanks for taking the question. I guess back to that product playbook that we 

talked about a few times, with kind of Reels now such a large share of kind of time 
spent on Instagram and Facebook, how do we think about the next leg of kind of 
monetization growth from here? In particular, as we kind of get back to kind of 
shopping on platform or other ways to monetize, any color there on the roadmap 
kind of just beyond ad insertion from here? 

 
 And then, Susan, just on the ad market, in particular, previously we've heard a lot 

about kind of Chinese-based advertiser contribution. Any color you could share 
there on kind of how that spend is trending? Thank you. 

 
Susan Li: Sure. Thanks, Mark. So Reels revenue continued to grow across Instagram and 

Facebook in Q1, and that's driven both by higher engagement and increased 
monetization efficiency through our ad ranking and delivery improvements.  

 
 And we -- as we've mentioned before, we don't plan on quantifying the impact from 

Reels going forward, but it remains a positive contributor to overall revenue. And 
we expect that there are going to be opportunities for us to continue improving 
performance and growing supply. 

 
 So on the performance improvements, we are investing in ongoing ranking 

improvements. We're continuing to make ads easier and more intuitive to interact 
with through work like optimizing call-to-actions and post-click experiences, which 

11 
 



are especially important for DR performance. And we're also optimizing ads to feel 
more native to Reels. 
 

 In Q1, we rolled out our GenAI image expansion tools across Facebook and 
Instagram Reels after having introduced it to Instagram Feed in Q4, and we're 
seeing, again, outsized adoption with small businesses. 

 
 So we're excited about the opportunities to continue making these ads more 

performant. And even though ads -- the Reels ad load, sorry, has increased over the 
last year, it remains lower on a per time basis than both Feed and Stories. 

 
 So we're going to continue to look for opportunities to thoughtfully grow it in the 

future and invest in creative ways to address the structural supply constraints of the 
Reels format being more video-heavy including higher density experiences and 
formats and increasingly personalizing ad loads, which we think will make sure that 
we're really putting ads in front of people when they're most likely to be interested 
and engaged with them. 

 
 The second question you asked was around China. Growth in spend from China 

advertisers remained strong in Q1. This was driven by online commerce and gaming, 
and it's reflected in our Asia Pacific advertiser segment, which remained the fastest-
growing region at 41% year-over-year in Q1. 

 
 Now we did see strength across other geographies as well including a 6-point 

acceleration in total revenue growth from North America advertisers. 
 
 So I would say that we aren't quantifying the Q1 contribution from China, and we 

don't have forward-looking expectations to share on quarterly China-based ad 
revenue, but I will say that we are lapping periods of increasingly strong demand 
over the course of 2024 given the recovery of China-based advertisers in 2023 from 
their prior pandemic-driven headwinds. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please go 

ahead. 
 
Douglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Can you just talk about what's changed most in 

your view in the business and the opportunity now versus three months ago? And is 
there anything you're more cautious about in revenue in the ad market? And is the 
AI opportunity just even bigger, and therefore, requiring more investment than 
expected? 

 
 And then, Susan, can you also just comment on how you're thinking about that 

ability to sustain growth rates over the next few quarters as you face tougher comps 
off a big base of ad dollars? Thanks.  

 
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can speak to the first one. I think we've gotten more optimistic and ambitious 

on AI. So previously I think that our work in this -- I mean when you were looking at 
last year, when we released Llama 2, we were very excited about the model and 

12 
 



thought that that was going to be the basis to be able to build a number of things 
that were valuable that integrated into our social products. 

 
 But now I think we're in a pretty different place. So with the latest models, we're 

not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new 
good social and commerce products. 

 
 I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading 

models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of 
additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. 

 
 So that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just 

view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come 
together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data, and the 
ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. 

 
 And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most 

used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously 
valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to 
stay at the leading edge of this. 

 
 And we're doing that at the time when we're also scaling the product before it is 

making money. So that's the analogy that I was making before, which is we've gone 
through some of those cycles before. 

 
 But fundamentally, I think if you look at the facts of what our team is able to 

produce, I think it just -- our optimism and ambition have just grown quite a bit, and 
I think that this is just going to end up being quite an important set of products for 
us. It was already going to be. Now I think it has the potential to be even more 
important. 

 
Susan Li: And I can take that second question, Doug. So we aren't giving full year 2024 

guidance. And obviously our revenue for the full year will be influenced by many 
factors including macro conditions and things that are harder to predict the further 
out you go. 

 
 And of course, over the course of 2024, we will also be lapping periods of 

increasingly strong demand. With that said, we expect to see good opportunities to 
continue growing engagement across our products, driven by the investments we 
made in AI-based content recommendations, our ongoing video work. And we also 
expect that we will continue to drive ads performance gains and continue to make 
our ads sort of more effective and deliver increasing value to advertisers. 

 
 One thing I'd share, for example, is that we actually grew conversions at a faster 

rate than we grew impressions over the course of this quarter. So we are -- we're 
expecting to -- which basically suggests that our conversion grade is growing and is 
one of the ways in which our ads are becoming more performant. 

 

13 
 



 So I feel like there's a lot of opportunity for us, both with our organic engagement 
growth and with -- and with continuing to make the ads better and to continue 
driving more results for advertisers. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Please 

go ahead. 
 
Justin Post: Great, thank you. First on the CapEx, mostly, you're kind of talking about an 

investment cycle here. Is there any way you could kind of use some of the 
Metaverse spend over into AI? Are they converging? And kind of use some of the 
money from the other areas to kind of fund the AI? And then second, longer-term 
investors are very focused on returns on capital. 

 
 Obviously great returns on CapEx in the past with your margins today. How do we 

think about the returns on the capital you're spending? How are you thinking about 
it, I guess, going forward two, three years out? Thank you. 

 
Susan Li: So on the -- I would say -- well I can start with the second part, and then I'll defer to 

Mark on the first one. In terms of measuring the ROI on our CapEx investments, 
we've broadly categorized our AI investments into two buckets. 

 
 I think of them as sort of core AI work and then strategic bets, which would include 

GenAI and the advanced research efforts to support that. And those are just really 
at different stages as it relates to being able to measure the return and drive 
revenue for our business. 

 
 So with our core AI work, we continue to have a very ROI-driven approach to 

investment, and we're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both 
engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains. 

 
 Now the second area, strategic bets, is where we are much earlier. Mark has talked 

about the potential that we believe we have to create significant value for our 
business in a number of areas including opportunities to build businesses that don't 
exist on us today. 

 
 But we'll need to invest ahead of that opportunity to develop more advanced 

models and to grow the usage of our products before they drive meaningful 
revenue. So while there is tremendous long-term potential, we're just much earlier 
on the return curve than with our core AI work. 

 
 What I'll say though is we're also building our systems in a way that gives us 

fungibility in how we use our capacity, so we can flex it across different use cases as 
we identify what are the best opportunities to put that infrastructure toward. 

 
Mark Zuckerberg: Sure. And then on the question of shifting resources from other parts of the 

company. I would say broadly, we actually are doing that in a lot of places in terms 
of shifting resources from other areas, whether it's compute resources or different 
things in order to advance the AI efforts. 

14 
 



 
 For Reality Labs specifically, I'm still really optimistic about building these new 

computing platforms long term. I mentioned in my remarks up front, that one of the 
bigger areas that we're investing in Reality Labs is glasses. We think that that's going 
to be a really important platform for the future. 

 
 Our outlook for that, I think, has improved quite a bit because previously we 

thought that that would need to wait until we have these full holographic displays 
to be a large market. And now we're a lot more focused on the glasses that we're 
delivering in partnership with Ray-Ban, which I think are going really well. And -- so 
that, I think, has the ability to be a pretty meaningful and growing platform sooner 
than I would have expected. 

 
 So it is true that more of the Reality Labs work, like I said, is sort of focused on the AI 

goals as well. But I still think that we should focus on building these long-term 
platforms, too. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. 

Please go ahead. 
 
Youssef Squali: Great, thank you very much. Mark, with the upcoming ban or sale of TikTok signed 

into law earlier today, how do you think that will impact the U.S. social media 
landscape and Meta in particular? And what do you say to people who believe that 
this is potentially a slippery slope in terms of the government picking winners and 
losers? And Susan, how big is Advantage+ in terms of the spend on the platform, 
and just in terms of its impact on overall CPMs stabilizing? Thank you very much. 

 
Susan Li: Thanks, Youssef. We've obviously been following the events related to TikTok 

closely, but at this stage, it is just too early, I think, to assess its impact or what it 
would mean for our business. To your second question on Advantage+, we're 
continuing to see good traction across our Advantage+ portfolio including both with 
solutions, I mentioned this, that automate individual steps of a campaign creation 
setup as well as ones that automate the full end-to-end process. 

 
 So on the single-step automation, Advantage+ Audience, for example, has seen 

significant growth in adoption since we made it the default audience creation 
experience for most advertisers in Q4, and that enables advertisers to increase 
campaign performance by just using audience inputs as a suggestion rather than a 
hard constraint. And based on tests that we ran, campaigns using Advantage+ 
Audience targeting saw, on average, a 28% decrease in cost per click or per 
objective compared to using our regular targeting. 

 
 On the end-to-end automation products like Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ 

App Campaigns, we're also seeing very strong growth. Mark mentioned the 
combined revenue flowing through those two has more than doubled since last 
year. And we think there's still significant runway to broaden adoption, so we're 
trying to enable more conversion types for Advantage+ Shopping. 

 

15 
 



 In Q1, we began expanding the list of conversions that businesses could optimize 
for. So previously it only supported purchase events, and now we've added 10 
additional conversion types. And we're continuing to see strong adoption now 
across verticals. 

 
 So generally, I would say we are building a lot more functionality into the 

Advantage+ tools over time. It’s also where a lot of our GenAI ads creative features 
have been introduced and where advertisers have the opportunity to experiment 
with those. And we'll keep looking to apply what we learn from these products 
more broadly to our ads investments over the course of the year. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Please 

go ahead. 
 
Kenneth Gawrelski: Thank you very much. As you look out through the coming period of product 

investment, how should we think about the relationship between Family of Apps 
revenue and cost growth? Is there any insight you can give us there? 

 
 And then maybe just one that's a little bit more specific to the G&A growth in 1Q. 

You called out legal expenses. Just wanted to see if there's anything one-time in 
there that would cause the elevated growth in 1Q? Thank you. 

 
Susan Li: Yes. On the second part of your question first, so on the G&A side, that was really 

driven by legal expenses. We recognized some accruals in Q1 related to ongoing 
legal matters, and you'll see more detail on that in the 10-Q. 

 
 On the first part of your question, which is really about sort of the kind of long-term 

margin profile of Family of Apps, we aren't giving guidance on that per se. 
 
 But one of the things that we really have been very disciplined about over the 

course of 2023 and continuing is really operating the business in a very efficiency 
oriented way. 

 
 So we're being very disciplined with allocation of new resources. This is a muscle 

that we really built over 2023 that we believe is important for us to keep carrying 
forward. And I think you'll see us continue to emphasize that, especially with the 
Family of Apps business being at the scale that it is. 

 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Please go 

ahead. 
 
Ross Sandler: Great. Mark, you partnered with Google and Bing for Meta AI organic search 

citations. So I guess stepping back, do you think that Meta AI longer term could 
bring in search advertising dollars at some point? Or do you view this as what others 
are doing, where you kind of attach a premium subscription tier once people kind of 
get going on it? 

 

16 
 



 And then the second question is, you mentioned that you guys are working on 
building AI tools for businesses and creators. 

 
 So just, I guess, how do you see the business model evolving when we all get to the 

stage of interacting with something like Taylor Swift's custom AI for merchandise or 
tickets or something like that? How is that going to play out? Thank you. 

 
Mark Zuckerberg: All right. So yes, on the Google and Microsoft partnerships, yes, I mean we work 

with them to have real-time information in Meta AI. It's useful. I think it's pretty 
different from search. We're not working on search ads or anything like that. I think 
this will end up being a pretty different business. 

 
 I do think that there will be an ability to have ads and paid content in Meta AI 

interactions over time as well as people being able to pay for, whether it's bigger 
models or more compute or some of the premium features and things like that. But 
that's all very early in fleshing out. 

 
 The thing that I actually think is probably the biggest clear opportunity is all the 

work around business messaging. That's in addition to the stuff that we're already 
doing, just generally to increase engagement and ads quality in the apps. 

 
 But the business messaging thing, I mean whether it's a creator or one of the 100-

plus million businesses on our platform, we basically want to make it very easy for 
all of these folks to set up an AI to engage with their community. 

 
 For a business, that's going to be, to be able to do sales and commerce and 

customer support. And I think it will be similar for creators, although there will be 
more of a kind of just fun and engaging part there, but a lot of creators are on the 
platform because they see this as a business too, whether they're trying to sell 
concert tickets or products or whatever it is that their business goal is. 

 
 And a lot of these folks either aren't advertising as much as they could or, in 

business, the business messaging parts, I think, are still relatively under-monetized 
compared to where they will be. And I think a lot of that is because the cost of 
engaging with people in messaging is still very high. 

 
 But AI should bring that down just dramatically for businesses and creators. And I 

think that that has the potential. That's probably the -- beyond just increasing 
engagement and increasing the quality of the ads, I think that that's probably one of 
the nearer-term opportunities, even though that will -- it's not like a next quarter or 
the quarter after that scaling thing, but it's -- but that's not like a five-year 
opportunity either. 

 
 So I think -- that is one that I think is going to be pretty exciting to look at. But yes, I 

mean as Meta AI scales too, I think that that will have its own opportunities to 
monetize, and we'll build that out over time. 

 

17 
 



 But like I tried to emphasize, we're in the phase of this where the main goal is 
getting many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part 
of what they do. That's the kind of next goal, building something that is super 
valuable. 

 
 We think this has the potential to be at a very large scale. And that's sort of the next 

step on the journey. 
 
Kenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question. 
 
Operator: And that question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead. 
 
Ronald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Mark, I want to follow up on a prior question 

that you mentioned optimism has grown internally quite a bit just with all the 
improvements and investments and innovations you're making. And we're seeing 
that in the experience just from a few days of Meta AI. 

 
 So can you just talk to us maybe how the 400 billion parameter model just might 

evolve the experience on Meta or how you think things might change over the next, 
call it, months, years, et cetera, as maybe messaging becomes a greater focus and 
things along those lines? So just a vision longer term? Thank you. 

 
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean I think that the next phase for a lot of these things are handling more 

complex tasks and becoming more like agents rather than just chatbots, right? So 
when I say chatbot, what I mean is if you send it a message and it replies to your 
message, right? So it's almost like a, almost a 1:1 correspondence.  

 
 Whereas what an agent is going to do is you give it an intent or a goal, and it goes 

off and probably actually performs many queries on its own in the background in 
order to help accomplish your goal, whether that goal is researching something 
online or eventually finding the right thing that you're looking to buy. 

 
 There's a lot of complexity and sort of different things that I think people don't even 

realize that they will be able to ask computers to do for them. And I think basically, 
the larger models and then the more advanced future versions that will be smaller 
as well are just going to enable much more interesting interactions like that. 

 
 So I mean if you think about this, I mean even some of the business use cases that 

we talked about, you don't really just want like a sales or customer support chatbot 
that can just respond to what you say. 

 
 If you're a business, you have a goal, right? You're trying to support your customers 

well and you're trying to position your products in a certain way and encourage 
people to buy certain things that map to their interests and what they’d be 
interested in. And that's more of like a multiturn interaction, right? 

 
 So the type of business agent that you're going to be able to enable with just a 

chatbot is going to be very naive compared to what we're going to have in a year 

18 
 



even, but beyond that, too, is just the reasoning and planning abilities if these things 
grow to be able to just help guide people through the business process of engaging 
with whatever your goals are as a creator or a business. 

 
 So I think that that's going to be extremely powerful. And I think the opportunity is 

really big. So -- and on top of that, I think what we've shown now is that we have 
the ability to build leading models in our company. 

 
 So I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to. And I think it's going to be a 

really good long-term investment. But I did just want to spell out on this call today, 
the extent to which we're focusing on this and investing in this for the long term 
because that's what we do. 

 
Kenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And we look 

forward to speaking with you again soon. 
 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you 

may now disconnect.
