MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CBRE First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants 
are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator 
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chandni Luthra, Global Head of FP&A and Investor Relations. 
Thank you. You may begin.

Chandni Luthra 
Executive Vice President and Head of Investor Relations and FP&A, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we 
posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an 
Excel file that contains additional supplemental material. 
 
Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements concerning the 
macro environment, our business outlook, our business plans, and capital allocation strategy, and our earnings 
and cash flow outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections, or other statements about future 
events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ 
materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-
looking statements, please refer to the morning's earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided 
reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP 
measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. 
 
I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our Chair and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Throughout our remarks, when we cite financial performance relative to expectations, we are referring to actual 
results against the outlook we provided on our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call in February unless otherwise 
noted. Also, as a reminder, our resilient businesses include facilities management, project management, property 
management, loan servicing, valuation, other portfolio services and recurring investment management fee. Our 
transactional businesses comprise property sales, leasing, mortgage origination, carried interest and incentive fee 
in the investment management business and development fees. 
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.

Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thank you, Chandni, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had a strong start to 2025 across our lines of business 
and around the world. Notably, as the first quarter ended, most of our businesses were performing better than 
expected and our new business pipelines were strong. This was equally true for both our resilient and 
transactional businesses. Since then, driven by uncertainty created by the tariff situation, our outlook has become 
less clear. Even in light of this, our current activity levels and new business pipelines continue to be strong, just 
somewhat less than they were. 
 
Looking at our Q1 results, we were particularly pleased with the performance of our Project Management and 
Building Operations & Experience segments in their first quarter of existence. Both segments generated strong

financial results and evidenced the type of operational and strategic gains we were hoping for and expected when 
we reconfigured the business this way. The gains included shared client access, insights into opportunities for 
product development and stronger positioning to pursue certain types of M&A. Another notable example that has 
quickly emerged is the ability to migrate strong leaders into more compelling positions. This is great for our 
emerging talent and great for CBRE. 
 
CBRE's strategy is underpinned by broad and deep capabilities across the dimensions of commercial real estate, 
asset type, client type, service type and geography. We couple this with a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow, 
and the experience and willingness to invest aggressively. This positioning allows us to drive resources into both 
steadily growing resilient businesses and high margin transactional businesses. The current market uncertainty 
aside, we are encouraged by the prospects that our strategic positioning and resource set have created for 
sustained, resilient growth. 
 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma, who will discuss the quarter and our outlook. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thank you, Bob. First quarter core EBITDA increased 27% and core EPS by 10% compared with last year's first 
quarter. Recall that last year's Q1 included a large one-time tax benefit. Without that benefit, core EPS grew 39% 
year-on-year. These strong consolidated results include an approximately 2% to 3% currency headwind in the 
quarter. To better reflect operating performance, I will reference growth rates and margins in local currency 
throughout the remainder of my remarks unless otherwise noted. As Bob noted, we saw strength across our 
platform as our resilient businesses generated net revenue growth of 17% for the quarter, nearly matching the 
18% increase in our transactional businesses. On a trailing 12-month basis, resilient businesses accounted for 
over 60% of our total SOP. 
 
Turning to our segments, Advisory Services had a particularly strong start to the year. Net revenue growth of 16% 
exceeded expectations led by strong leasing and capital markets activity. Global leasing revenue growth 
accelerated to 19% in Q1 from 15% in Q4 of 2024. The US is particularly strong as overall leasing revenue 
increased 24%, driven by a 38% increase in office leasing revenue, which reached its highest level for any first 
quarter. We saw continued strong activity across gateway markets with each of the six markets delivering greater 
than 30% growth and over 55% growth in aggregate. At the same time, many non-gateway markets, including 
Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Miami delivered double-digit growth. US retail leasing was also very strong, up 34%, 
and industrial leasing saw 12% growth as third party logistics companies drove higher demand. Outside the US, 
leasing trends were notably strong in Southeast Asia, especially office leasing in India, as well as in certain 
countries in Europe. 
 
Capital markets activity was also strong. Global property sales revenue increased 13%, once again led by a 26% 
gain in the US, which saw a significant uptick in multifamily and industrial asset sales. Outside the US, we saw 
notable strength in Continental Europe. Our mortgage origination business had another strong quarter, with 53% 
growth in origination fees. US loan origination volume rose 69%, led by strong activity from banks and insurance 
companies on the back of continued outsized growth in refinancing, as well as strong demand for acquisition 
financing. Overall advisory SOP rose 31%, delivering strong operating leverage as SOP on net revenue margin 
increased by more than 200 basis points. 
 
In the BOE segment, net revenue grew 22% with strength across facilities management, property management 
and contributions from Industrious, which we acquired at the beginning of this year. In facilities management, the 
enterprise business saw strong demand from clients in sectors such as technology, life sciences and healthcare.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
We also had a particularly strong quarter with hyperscale data center clients. In our local business, revenue grew 
by double digits, with continued outsized growth in the US as we expand our market share, as well as continued 
strength in the UK. Strong property management net revenue growth slightly exceeded expectations. This 
segment is benefiting from enhanced operating leverage, primarily resulting from last year's cost efficiency 
initiatives. This contributed to 38% SOP growth and a 100 basis points of net margin expansion. 
 
Turning to the Project Management segment, we have completed the first quarter after combining CBRE's legacy 
project management business under Turner & Townsend leadership. Revenue grew 9% in line with our 
expectations, with continued mid-double-digit growth from legacy Turner & Townsend and mid-single-digit growth 
from CBRE's legacy project management. As we have outlined previously, we expect the integrated project 
management business to more closely resemble Turner & Townsend's growth and margin profile over time. In the 
legacy Turner & Townsend business, we had strong wins in infrastructure in the UK and Middle East as well as 
large new program mandates in real estate and the pipeline looks solid. Project management SOP margin on net 
revenue continued to improve year-on-year driving SOP growth of 14%. And it is noteworthy that this margin does 
not yet reflect the cost and operating synergies of bringing these two businesses together. 
 
In our REI segment, investment management operating profit was up 43% year-on-year, exceeding expectations, 
primarily driven by higher net promotes and recurring asset management fees. AUM ended Q1 at $149 billion, up 
about $3 billion since the end of Q4, driven by net inflows, higher asset values and favorable currency movement. 
Our development operating profit was in line with expectations. We continue to grow our US and process portfolio 
starting 12 projects in the first quarter, compared with 26 in all of 2024 and capitalizing an additional five deals. 
 
Now I'll discuss free cash flow, leverage and capital allocation. Trailing 12 months free cash flow was nearly $1.5 
billion, reflecting 93% free cash flow conversion above the high end of our targeted 75% to 85% range. We 
repurchased nearly $600 million worth of shares since the end of the fourth quarter, underscoring our commitment 
to return capital to our shareholders and the unrealized value we see in CBRE shares. In total, we deployed 
approximately $1 billion of capital year-to-date across M&A, share repurchases and co-investments and ended 
the quarter with net leverage of less than 1.5 turns. Our capital deployment strategy remains consistent with our 
historical practice. We prioritize M&A and principal investments into our REI business and will balance our spend 
with share repurchases as long as our share price remains attractive. Absent large scale M&A or the onset of a 
recession, we continue to expect to end the year with under 1 turn of net leverage and we are willing to lever up to 
2 turns for the right acquisitions. 
 
Heading into Q2, our strong Q1 performance, strong pipelines and strong current activity, would have prompted 
us to raise our full year guidance to the high end of the range we set in February. However, given the significant 
market uncertainty related to tariffs, absent increased interest rate volatility or a recession, we are maintaining our 
2025 core EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10. Given our success in increasing the resilient parts of our 
business and our strong balance sheet, we are better positioned than ever before to not only weather a recession, 
but to take advantage of the opportunities created in a downturn. 
 
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony 
Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Thanks and good morning. I think, Bob, you mentioned the pipeline's still strong, just somewhat less than maybe 
what it was. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color or detail on kind of what's been changing over the last 
few weeks, whether it's more wait and see, whether deals have been canceled, maybe whether there's certain 
regions that stand out as changing the most or business lines. Just any context around some of the more recent 
changes would be great. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
You bet, Tony. And I want to stress you said it and I want to stress it, its things didn't go from good to bad. Things 
went from really good to not as good. We ended the quarter with strong pipelines. And as we've gone through the 
latter part of April, we've seen really good activity, but we have seen some implications of what's going on with the 
tariffs. So for instance, let's start with capital raising in our investment management business, we've raised almost 
$5 billion in the first quarter. We were surprised that we raised that much and we ended the quarter with a lot of 
enthusiasm and some of the capital sources from around the world that invest into our funds and the accounts we 
manage have slowed down a little. So our expectations have gone – by the end of the first quarter, had gone 
beyond where we were going into the year. And I'd say we've kind of pulled back roughly consistent with where 
we were going into the year now. 
 
If you look at project management, lot of activity in project management, a lot of activity and Emma called it out in 
her comments and things like infrastructure, some big programs and projects around the world. But some 
corporates now who are uncertain about what's going to happen with them due to the tariffs, whether we might go 
into recession, have started to slow down on some of their bigger programs. So we went from a really enthusiastic 
picture to one where there's some choppiness out there. On leasing, one of the ironies with what's going on right 
now, industrial outperformed, that wasn't ironic, really just the market was good and industrial outperformed and 
office outperformed by quite a bit. 
 
We think industrial is going to come back to kind of where we thought it was going to be going into the year. We 
don't really think that's going to be the case with office. What we have going on with office right now is two 
dynamics. One is a scarcity circumstance. And it's not just Park Avenue. It's all over the gateway markets and 
other big cities in second and third tier markets. Companies realize that office space is important to them. They 
realize that there is somewhat of a return to the mean and that they're forcing that in some cases, and it's 
happening on its own in some cases. And as a result, because there hasn't been much new office space created 
over the last years, last few years, for obvious reasons, the office space that's out there is in big demand and the 
choppiness that we're now seeing in people's confidence about the economy is really not impacting their 
enthusiasm for leasing office space that much at this point. So that's the one area where we probably don't see a 
lot of change. There are some big office leases that have big tenant rep. The people are pulling back a little bit 
from, but we're not seeing a lot of change there.

We're continuing to see some good opportunities to capitalize development deals because what's going on now is 
keeping other capital sources out of the market. And we've talked kind of at length over the last couple of years 
about how when things are like they are now, you can gain real advantage there. So that's kind of the picture 
we're seeing out there. Emma, I don't know if there's anything you would add to that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
I think you captured all of it. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for all of that. And then I just have a follow up on project management. Now that it's 
broken out and combined, I guess as we look out it's been an area where you've been pretty confident about the 
growth and I guess, you've finished projects and then you have to replace them. And so I guess like, what can we 
look at as we start to look out the next few years that the replacements are going to be big enough to net to sort of 
the growth level of that that you've kind of talked about like kind of in the double digits and stuff here like 
especially given, like you said, some of the – some of these things may pull back a bit, like is it just the pipeline 
that you say you have or how do we kind of look at that? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
It's really important to kind of dissect what's going on with our project management business. So the market's 
going to be potentially a little slower in some areas for the reasons we've already articulated on our prepared 
remarks and then the response I gave you to your first question, Tony. But you have to look at specifically what's 
going on inside CBRE and inside the combined CBRE, Turner & Townsend business. We are in the door and 
doing work for a lot of big corporates that had opportunities that we weren't positioned to execute on because they 
were big, complex projects. We have Trammell Crow Company that sources land sites and can do land 
development for big projects that we weren't positioned to execute on ourselves. 
 
Turner & Townsend had opportunities that they didn't have the talent to execute on. So in the United States, 
Turner & Townsend did not have a sizable platform. They didn't have the ability to take on certain things. So 
there's the trajectory of the market and the volume activity broadly defined in the market. There's also the 
positioning of our combined business that provides just a much better overlay to whatever the market 
circumstances are than we had previously. And again, we now have, I think one of the things that's going to 
surprise people that watch our company over the next couple of years is just how much different that project 
management business is than it used to be. It's got 15,000 project management, program management and cost 
consultancy professionals. It's got a huge opportunity that it was lightly penetrating here in the United States. So 
there's going to be a market circumstance that we're all going to learn about, that's going to be impacted to some 
degree by tariffs in a recession or not. But then there's going to be the business we've built and the trajectory of 
that combined business relative to what it would have been had we not combined those businesses. And that's 
where a lot of our enthusiasm for the growth of that business comes from. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed 
with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julien Blouin 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I think you mentioned in the release that you're maintaining guidance 
absent increased interest rate volatility or recession. I guess, can you give us a sense of what a recession would 
look like for your earnings? And just given how much higher the mix of resilient businesses are now versus in 
prior recessions, how much better would your earnings sort of hold up this time around? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. Thanks, Julien. So first, I just want to comment on our guidance. We maintain our guidance and we do 
think there's a wider range of outcomes than we thought back in February when we first provided our guidance for 
the year. And it's difficult to provide specifics, but we can frame how we're thinking about where we'll end up on 
the year. And I do – these components are really important to acknowledge. First, absent tariff uncertainty, as Bob 
alluded to in his remarks going into the second quarter, given the strong performance in Q1, given the momentum 
we're seeing in Q2, we would have likely increased our guidance from the range that we set at the beginning of 
the year. Now we would end up in the high end of our range if we simply flowed through our Q1 outperformance. 
The midpoint of our range would mean something like leasing and capital markets slows down in the back half of 
the year. And on a downside, it would mean that those transactional revenue slows down even more, but we're 
likely not in a recession. 
 
In terms of your question around a recession, it's difficult to frame that because of the severity and degree of a 
recession can vary significantly. But what we do know is because we are significantly more resilient than we were 
even a few years ago, definitely more resilient than we were coming out of the GFC. And as a reminder, we're 
60% resilient SOP today. Back in 2011 we were roughly 11%, 20% SOP was resilient. So we've meaningfully 
increased the resilience of our business and those – that resilient profits is growing at a double digit rate. So 
today, if you were to put our business through the same type of a recession that we saw in the GFC, our declines 
would be materially lower so GFC our declines were 85% peak to trough. Now it would be less than half of that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julien Blouin 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Thank you. That's very helpful. And I guess turning to sort of capital markets activity, it sounds like things continue 
to progress well thus far in April, just maybe not quite as strong as they were. What are you seeing maybe in 
terms of your pipelines of future capital markets activity or broker opinions of value? What is that telling you about 
where we could trend in the second quarter? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So I'll speak to what we saw through Q1 and then what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2. Through Q1, with 
strong capital markets activity, particularly in February and March, it slowed down somewhat, but not to a 
meaningful degree. And when you got into April, there was somewhat of a pause because of the significant 
amount of uncertainty. But we're not yet seeing any of that impact our transaction activity. So in the first few 
weeks of April, our investment sales activity is very strong, it's actually accelerated. On the loan origination side, 
we saw a significant increase in rate locks when the tenure fell below 4% for a short period of time. So activity is

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
continuing and our pipelines remain very strong. And our belief is, as long as rates on the capital market side, the 
tenure begin to go above 5%, activity is going to continue. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julien Blouin 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Thank you very much. That's very helpful.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please 
proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ronald Kamdem 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Hey, just two quick ones. So one is just on the project management business going back to that. And I think the 
comments that the margins do not reflect the cost of operating synergies and so on and so forth. I'm just curious if 
you can give us some high level thoughts and just the margin profile of that business and sort of in this 
environment, are there any other sort of tools that you could use to protect margins? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So we believe the long term margin for our entire project management segment should trend towards what the 
legacy Turner & Townsend project margins have been, which, as you know, have trended towards the mid to high 
teens range. And our legacy project management business has had a margin that's slightly below that. So as 
you're seeing in our results, it's the blend of that margin. It's a little below 15%, we think simply through cost 
synergies, redundancies that you really haven't gone after, back office integration, we'll be able to improve that 
margin over the next couple of years. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ronald Kamdem 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Great. And then my second question is just capital allocation, obviously, the buyback in the quarter, just curious 
how conversations are going on the acquisition front in a market like this? Do they sort of die off? Do you become 
more opportunistic? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. Ronald, as it relates, I think you're talking when you say acquisition, you're talking to M&A, right? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ronald Kamdem 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Exactly. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. So a couple of things. First of all, we have refined and refined our M&A strategy over the past few years. 
We did a lot of strategy work, we talked about it last year. And we have a very clear view as to where we want to 
do M&A in the business now. And what we're finding is that as the markets remain choppy, the kind of companies 
that we're interested in, in part we're interested in because they really like the idea of being part of our platform.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
And it's our observation in the various conversations we're taking part of now that choppiness builds momentum 
for us and the M&A work we're doing. And we would expect that to be the case and we would expect the 
approach we take to M&A to play out nicely in a difficult market. And we've – I've been around now for multiple 
downturns and we always talk about, oh, gee, when things get tough, we'll take advantage of it. And we do to 
varying degrees, I don't think we've ever been as well positioned to take advantage of a downturn as we are now 
because of our balance sheet in part, but also because of the success we've had with the kinds of companies that 
we're interested in acquiring and are interested in being acquired by us.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please 
proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting with Bob. Really appreciate the detailed 
commentary on Tony's prior question. But I wanted to drill down a little more on the industrial leasing outlook. It's 
great to hear about the outperformance there in the first quarter, but I would just think it would be tough for clients 
to make leasing decisions right now with industrial footprints, given all the moving pieces until there's more tariff 
clarity. So curious if you have any additional color on what you're seeing there, especially later in the quarter and 
so far in April? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, it is tough to give more clarity than we've given. But here's what we think. We think the kind of, as we called 
it, outperformance in industrial leasing that we saw through the first 90 days of the year is going to come back a 
little and it's going to come back to where we thought things were going to be. I will say that the uncertainty – 
we've talked about it at length here, what we think is going to happen and how we think it's going to play out. And 
one of the ways we've concluded that you can look at it is a lot of the momentum was with 3PLs. And the reason 
3PLs is because the primary users of the space have decided the uncertainty is going to cause them to back off 
on commitments a little. So they instead lease from the 3PLs, it gives them more flexibility and then in turn the 
3PLs have to do leases. The big leases, the 700,000 square foot and above have slowed down below that, there's 
been good momentum and we think we're going to continue to see that, but we're not going to see that to the 
degree that we saw it in the first quarter. And so, to be a little redundant here, we're kind of assuming that 
industrial leasing is going to be back to where we thought it was going to be when we entered the year, which is 
kind of flattish to 2024.

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe one quick follow up for Emma. If we do see macro trends 
deteriorate, become a bigger headwind, how would you think about managing the cost structure? You obviously 
had some efficiency initiatives in recent years. I think CBRE always seems to be operating pretty leanly. So are 
there levers you can pull to support profit trend, I guess, if top line trends do deteriorate?

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. Absolutely. And it's something that we're always planning for and thinking about. And I think we've 
materially improved our ability to quickly react and take action when we need to around our cost structure. And 
we've always talked about our cost structure being inherently variable. Our commissions move, our commission 
cost move with revenue or decline with revenue with our bonuses and profit shares and mostly our transactional 
businesses flex with revenue. And the other levers we have are our typical discretionary expenses, we can pull 
back when we need to hire and we can pull back when we need to very quickly, we think we have a lever with 
recruiting, if that's something we think makes sense. But the main point is that we have the ability to act and we've 
shown that in the past two recessions or downturns in real estate. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just [ph] what in fast quote (00:31:19) hiring, I guess, have you – have CBRE 
changed hiring plans for the year? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
We've not.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Manus Ebbecke with Evercore ISI. Please proceed 
with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Manus Ebbecke 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Good morning and thanks for taking the question. This is Manas on for Steve Sakwa. Just wanted to quickly ask 
about one item and that is currency headwinds. I know you quoted around 2% to 3% of headwinds in the first 
quarter. The dollar has obviously weakened a little bit since in April. So I wanted to check in and see if you have 
any thoughts around how currency headwinds potentially may impact the second quarter more than the first 
quarter or what your general outlook is and how that is fitting into kind of like the guidance range? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So it's obviously difficult, very difficult to predict what will happen. But if you just take today's forward curve, those 
headwinds are pretty much entirely removed. So they would be reversed. They've become tailwinds in the second 
quarter. But I do want to emphasize that this, we all know that this is moving very quickly and it's pretty volatile. 
So it's just difficult to predict what will actually happen over the next three quarters.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
Okay, I mean, for sure, that makes a lot of sense. And then maybe one follow up question on capital usage for – 
you obviously used around, I think, around $600 million worth of share buybacks so far. And we wanted just to 
see if that was maybe changed. How you think about share repurchases going into the second quarter as 
obviously the macro environment has changed a bit? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So our capital deployment strategy has been unchanged for a few years now. We always prioritize M&A and REI 
as co-investment and we're actively looking at a number of deals in our pipeline across both of those pieces. And 
if those convert and that's what we'll prioritize with our capital and as we're seeing that there's a slowdown in M&A 
or REI, which we're not seeing right now, then we'll balance that out with share repurchases as long as we believe 
our price is attractive. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Manus Ebbecke 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Perfect. Thank you. That's it for me. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Please proceed 
with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Yes. Thank you for taking the question. First, just wanted to go back to one of Emma's comments. I think you 
mentioned that as long as the tenure remains below 5% is kind of the key level that you can sort of maintain your 
pace in capital markets activity and deals that still happen. I guess I just want to make sure we're interpreting that 
correctly, is that I guess you think even up to that 5% level, you can kind of hit what's in your guide in terms of 
this, I believe you've called it a sort of slow and steady recovery in capital markets. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So there's a lot of elements that go into whether or not capital markets activity will continue, specifically to loan 
originations, we see activity continue as long as interest rates are stable and below 5%. We've seen things 
materially slow down. If we believe things have materially slowed down, they go above 5%. But what's important 
to remember on the loan origination side is that a 55% or 60% of the activity that we're seeing is refinancing. And 
those deals need to continue to happen. And so we are confident that that activity will continue. But yes, it's right 
staying below a certain level, but they also need to be stable. The volatility creates – it just causes investors to 
pause. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Right. That's helpful. Okay. And then so just to clarify one of your other comments, I think was that activity slowed 
right after – right at the beginning of this month, but has actually accelerated since. Was that in reference to just 
the loan origination or advisory sales as well?

Its sales in March, sales slowed somewhat, but it's just – it's one month, it's hard to see a trend and it picked right 
back up in April. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Okay, got it. And then one more maybe a kind of a thematic question for Bob. Stepping back, just thinking about 
kind of the political risk in the broader sense with this administration. I think one of the thoughts out there is that 
we could have these rolling 90 day extensions with the tariffs as the White House negotiates. And this could go on 
for a very long time. So just kind of curious, how do you think longer term about how to discount that uncertainty 
in such a fluid situation as you think about the future of your business because it is certainly kind of a unique 
situation? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, it is, Peter, very unique. And I think it's fair to say that we don't have any insight into the uncertainty that 
others haven't already articulated. The big banks have reported and they've given their view on that. And they 
spend a whole lot more money to try to figure out that kind of stuff than we do. We've adjusted our view of things 
to take into account considerable uncertainty, which causes us to have a view of higher risk of recession than we 
had before, which causes us to have a view of a higher risk of people being on the sidelines because they just 
don't want to act in uncertain times and that's all factored into what we've said about the performance we expect 
for the rest of the year. And I don't think we have – it's not that we're unwilling to declare beyond that. We just 
don't have insight beyond that. It all assumes a lot of uncertainty, a lot of choppiness and a risk of recession that 
we didn't have before. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
All right. That's helpful. Thanks for the time.

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with 
your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade J. Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Thank you very much. Can you give any color on what drove the margin gains in Advisory and BOE? Net revenue 
is pretty close to our forecast, so operating leverage was much stronger. Just wanted to see if there's any further 
point you can make on that. It was much stronger even considering the revenue growth within capital markets and 
leasing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So Advisory, it is incremental margins on the transaction revenue we had – as we've spoken to both leasing and 
investment sales and loan origination activity, which is all higher margin, came in above our expectations. Within 
BOE, the 100 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter was in line with what we saw in the back half of 
last year and that was all the cost savings initiatives that we started mid-2024 and you're seeing the run rate 
continue to flow in. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade J. Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Okay. Thanks very much. You've been leaning into key areas as the market went through a correction over the 
last couple of years, specifically in REI and data centers. And I was wondering if you're seeing any slowdown in 
activities within data centers, whether it be new deals or leasing. And then on the REI side, are you changing how 
you think about making new investments, considering growing uncertainty around construction costs?

CBRE Group, Inc. (CBRE) Corrected Transcript 
Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025 
 
Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah, Jade, we're – the way to think about us as it relates to data centers is we're a service provider, not an 
owner. And we had a really good quarter with data centers. We have a data center services business that 
includes an M&A deal we did called Direct Line, which provides some additional tech and technical services that 
go what we had done historically, very good, very good quarter for that business. That acquisition is meaningfully 
outperforming underwriting. Turner & Townsend is a big project manager, the creation of new data centers, they 
have a lot of work going on. They have seen some pullback from some of the hyperscalers that we all read about. 
But they're pretty much at capacity in terms of their ability to do that kind of work. So you're not seeing that impact 
us. 
 
Trammell Crow Company has kind of a unique role in the data center world. They are in a position to acquire land 
and create the improvements you need on land, both kind of soft improvements in terms of entitlements and then 
the hard improvements in terms of gaining access to electricity that makes that land a lot more valuable than it 
was when they acquired it. We think that that is going to play out for us this year the way we thought it was going 
to play out when we went into the year. So some of the headlines you're reading about a little bit of the slowdown 
by hyperscalers and some of the big name hyperscalers and starting new projects is not likely to roll through our 
business this year relative to what we thought we were going to do with that business. And we've seen a good 
start to the year and expect it to be a strong finish to the year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade J. Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Okay. And then just a follow up to that was on the construction costs, if just broadly Trammell Crow is changing at 
all, how they're thinking about new investments, considering uncertainty around construction costs. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair, President & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
The first thing I want to comment on is risk in the in-process portfolio associated with construction costs that might 
be impacted by tariffs in Trammell Crow Company. When you look at that in process portfolio, a significant portion 
of it is either complete or near complete and leasing up or just ready to be sold. So that just definition-ally wouldn't 
be impacted by the costs associated with tariffs. When you go to the stuff that's under-construction, much of that 
is protected by GMP contracts. So if their cost increases, you'd be protected there. And beyond the GMP 
contracts, we have contingencies inside our budgets. And when we report the amount of profit we have captured 
in our portfolio, we assume those contingencies will be used. So if the contingencies get chewed up by some cost 
increase, then that's significantly covered beyond those GMP contracts by the contingencies we carry. 
 
But even beyond that, I think there is a little misunderstanding of if you build a $100 project, what goes into it. 
Probably half of the project or more is land, engineering cost, site work costs, commissions on lease up, et cetera, 
that won't be impacted at all. And then when you get to the other half, the construction costs, there's a huge 
component of construction costs that are driven by labor. There's a very significant portion of construction costs 
that are materials sourced here in the US, not from overseas. And then there's a smaller portion that would be 
sourced from places where the tariffs might impact that. When you roll that – all that through the number and 
overlay the GMP contracts, there's just not a lot of risk from tariffs in that portfolio of projects. And then when you 
look at future projects, a lot of dynamics will come into play. But if we see costs increases and if we see inflation 
roll through our economy as a result of those cost increases, and if you don't see a lot of new projects starts, 
which we don't think you will, what you're likely to see is rental increases that will cover the cost of construction

that goes up as a result of tariffs. So, we're very attentive to what might happen in this regard, but we're feeling 
pretty well mitigated at this point.

Operator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Seth Bergey with Citi. Please 
proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Seth Bergey 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to some of your comments on leasing. Can you 
provide any kind of color as to, if you're seeing any differences between smaller or larger tenants or US tenants 
versus kind of global tenants? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So I can give you a high level both office and industrial what's driving that growth, globally on office pretty much 
all metrics are up square footage, term, rent is up slightly. On the industrial side, is as you would expect, square 
footage is up slightly, term is up slightly, and rent's been flat. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
